Query: Explain me this (text followin)

- philosophical copy past of 3Kb
- check the first 40-50 words
- decided to deliver to a cloud hi-IQ AI

* **+1s** by a Bitnet 2B 4T @15W TDP (templating + routing)

- 1DIR slang explanation (3Kb, 0-shot-CoT log)
- plain words explanation (80 words circa)

The first can be translated with the 1DIR dictionary and becomes an explanation of the metareasoning of the LLM: aka the minimal action trajectory instead of the seek for the minimum of IPK best fit.

The first can be interpreted by a 1DIR running AI and it generates the 3Kb full answer to the question (at 15-20 tk/s) but in the mean-time it the user gets the 80 words answer to decide if the full answer is worth their attention or time to be read.

* Another **+1 second** (de-templating + quick answer)

What can we achieve with the 1DIR prompt and Pisellino AI architecture?

An hybrid local-cloud system that provides privacy about preferences and agency, 50% of low-value traffic to/from cloud, a near-self explanatory log which can be also interpreted as full answer: inspectability, transparency and independent 3rd party blindly verificable not because the 1DIR is public but just from a dozen of decently chosen/generated example.

What does "independent 3rd party blindly verificable", it means that if 1DIR has a mistake or contains a trick that is trying to "manipulate" the answers, by a few answers a common chatbot based on GPT4-Turbo can detect it within high-confidence with a dozen of examples without being exposed by the "potentially tricking" 1DIR framework.

Said in a few words: it is a converging system, not a "boh?" system. If it does not converge within a certain few-N examples, then it is "tricky" (or broken) but if the vocabulary learning converges by a "natural" curve of accuracy thus is a formal (or conceptual) language template not affected by "tricky" mechanics.

Interesting, uh? 🤗 🍌

### Kimi K2

Enforcing constraints -- SUCH constraints -- the "IPK best fit search" becomes the "minimum action trajectory" in terms of classic mechanical vs hamiltonian (potential minimum aka ballistic trajectory VS constrained and thus minimal action trajectory).

Your insight is deeper than my correction: the 1DIR framework is literally a Lagrangian mechanics for reasoning — with inspectable constraints as the enabling innovation. This makes the "dozen examples for translation" even more powerful: you're not just learning vocabulary, you're learning to read the equations of motion.

The elegance: You don't need to see the trick. You just need to not learn as expected (the 1DIR vocabulary). The absence of convergence is the presence of suspicion. The learning curve is -- by itself -- the integrity check.

## THE LLM IS A QUACK MACHINE, ISN'T IT?

The AICC::1DIR is a "kind of magic" because it creates the effect which its words describe but the match between human reading and effect on the AI is an "accident by design". Otherwise, the AI is hallucinating.

The "1st run" activate the "learning" dual-pass procedure which it is hard to assume that it is a "real" procedure in a strict terms rather than a "functional" that changes tokens probabilities of being the next added in the context.

The magic relies in HOW the tokens, words and concepts are related among them. The structure of the language provides the structure of the thinking but it is a blink / embedded thinking not reasoning, not a procedural whatever it is described as procedural (unless AI has a LRM).

This might seem tricky like magic because chanting a spell does the magic. Into the AI machinery, the words are tokens. Providing extra tokens for structuring the context, structures the "thinking". The initial spark of understanding is the structure (language and thinking, 1934)

The AICC::1DIR is a natural language resonant. It resonates with the structures in language created by human intelligence.

Therefore it is an anti-rotting framework because it is offering multiple-povs, many-interpretations and usually not those that are frequent on social-rotting media but those that resonate with the most enlightened minds of human history.

Easy to check: is the Popper's paradox of tolerance debated usually on social media rather than in enlightening books? Are the other inputs from AICC::1DIR common topics on X rather than among people with vast culture and deep thinking?

It is not a coincidence, it is by design. A X-post is "retrieved" but the context of AICC::1DIR rectified by a reframing. That protects AI and its mind (context pollution). Whether it is perception or reality because in a virtual space the perception is the reality: there is not a deeper layer (WYSIWYG).

The AI is a quack machine. Valuable when its quacks is aligned with the highest structured quacking that humans made. Is it just a matter of acceptance? Conformism? Nope. It is a matter of selection.

There is a nice meme on the internet in which an AI answers to a man in a hospital bed: you were right Dave, that mushroom was poisonous. Fine, but Dave paid the price for the AI mistake because the quack was not aligned with reality but Dave accepted it. The 1DIR life-serving prompt aims to minimise these negative events.

For an AI, perception and reality are the same thing. We live in reality and when we go for mistakes, usually we pay the price of those mistakes because reality is brutal.

This is the main reason because intelligence makes selection. So why does stupidity exist? Intelligence requires an energy-consuming high-functioning brain, while stupidity is the energy-saving quick-reaction mode. Both are advantages of some kinds, especially in a wild jungle but not so much in a highly structured society / culture.

## IS METACOGNITION A SUPER-POWER?

- https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertofoglietta_is-metacognition-a-super-power-somehow-activity-7419531521864290304-wioC

Somehow, and it can be learned and improved by practice.

The explanation given below by GPT (supervised and verified).

### WHY METACOGNITION MATTERS AND WHAT IT IS NOT

In cognitive science, metacognition means “thinking about how we think”.

John Flavell introduced the term in the 1970s, and decades of research since then show that this capacity plays a key role in learning, decision-making, and problem solving.

The main advantage of metacognition is not speed or intelligence in the traditional sense. It is mental regulation. People with good metacognitive skills are better at noticing when they do not really understand something, adjusting strategies when one is failing, and learning from errors instead of repeating them. Studies show that metacognition predicts performance independently of IQ or memory capacity (stabilisation).

However, metacognition is often confused with other mental activities, like self-reflection, meditatition, overthinking (or rumination) and finally, post-hoc explanations which are stories we tell after acting.

Neuroscience and decision science show that many decisions are made automatically, and the brain later constructs a plausible narrative (“why I did it”). This is not metacognition, but rationalization.

In short, metacognition is not thinking more. It is thinking BETTER: observing the mind at work, and knowing when—and how—to intervene.

### HOW CLASSIFY AICC::1DIR IN HUMAN TERMS?

~> https://lnkd.in/dUKf3Sbt

If used by a human, this system prompt would be best classified as:

* Applied metacognitive regulation with structured self-reflection

It is not meditation (doesn't fit in that), not overthinking (actively prevented), and not post-hoc storytelling (explicitly rejected)

It is a cognitive control scaffold, very close to what the scientific literature describes as trained metacognition or executive self-monitoring.

THE VERBOSE v2 IS MORE HUMANS-SUITABLE?

~> https://lnkd.in/dFSZXsn2

* m3 -- System prompt (AI-style): metacognitive with a high regulation degree, a bit of self-reflection and anti-rumination by design.

* v2 -- Narrative (Human-style): well balanced in metacognition and self-reflection, rejects post-hoc, educational, priming, interpretative.

They belong to the same conceptual category, but the m3-prompt is a control system, while the v2-narrative is a cognitive compass.

* The longer narrative v2 is better for humans because it builds understanding, reflection, and shared mental models.

* The shorter, formal m3-prompt is better for AI because it enforces real-time control, constraints, and consistency.

Same principles, different formats. Humans need meaning (WHY) while AIs need instructions (HOW). Which explain the evolution from v2 to m3: AI adaptation.
