<H2 id="dual-psu-for-fujistsu-esprimo-e910">Dual PSU for Fujistsu Esprimo E910</H2>
<p/>
In the previous article I presented the project of adapting a Nvidia Tesla K80 for being used within a PC/Desktop in particular for locally running an AI model.
<p/>
<li><a href="tesla-k80-with-esprimo-p910.html#" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Tesla K80 with Esprimo P910</a></li>
<p/>
This paper is going to present the way in which I decided to provide that system with a secondary 350W power supply unit in order to sustain the K80 consumption.
<p/>
<hr>
<p/>
<H3 id="introduction">Introduction</H3>
<p/>
Among the main issues one in particular was related to the Fujitsu Esprimo P910 which like many others slim-tower with Zero-Watt technology includes a customised power supply unit which has a single connection to the mainboard with a 16-pin connector and cannot be replaced with any standard ATX PSU also because its own way of being fixed to the case.
<p/>
Well - <i>cannot be replaced</i> - in the sense of a spare part becuase mechanical changes to the case in order to fit a standard PSU supply as well as providing a cable for adpat the standard 20/24-pins ATX connector to the motherboard 16-pin one, is always possible.
<p/>
However, as you can imagine some mods outcome are way impredictable compared to assembly commercially available parts. In particular when 220V power supply is involved.
<p/>

<H3 id="the-dvd-bay">The DVD bay</H3>
<p/>
A place in which a secondary PSU can be installed in the Esprimo P910 case is the DVD reader bay, and there are two. I am not going to use that device, hence both available.
<p/>
Despite this the two bays are separated with a frame that also provide a substantial distancing to the front side unless the PSU would have a size compareble with a DVD reader.
<p/>
After a search on Internet, I have decided that ATX PSU built for PoS devices which has a standard size of 1U = 1 rack Unit can fit into that area replacing the DVD reader.
<p/>

<p/>
<H3 id="powering-up">Powering up</H3>
<p/>
Once decided where to place the 2nd PSU there are two more task to face:
<p/>
<li style='list-style-type: none;'><b>1.<span style='visibility: hidden;'>--</span></b>let the two PSUs have the same GND (N-line, ground) to avoid dangerous fluctiations;</li>
<p/>
<li style='list-style-type: none;'><b>2.<span style='visibility: hidden;'>--</span></b>let the 2nd PSU powering-up the system when the first sees grounded the PSU-ON line.</li>
<p/>
To solve at once these two issues, I have decided to use an adaptor, specifically designed. Which is a piece of hardware very common.
<p/>
To be precise, I have found three kind of these adaptors plus their different versions. Two seems very similar and are equally cheap, one have a on/off switch for disabling the secondary PSU when it is not in use. While the third offer a more options and features. In this specific case, the simplest ATX 24-pins with SATA dual connectors is enough.
<p/>

<p/>
<H3 id="psu-cabling-">PSU cabling </H3>
<p/>
The Nvidia Tesla K80 is quite old and it requires a basic 8-pin CPU male connector to be powered. Unfortunately, the 1U PSU that I have chose has not such connector but the older 4-pin CPU male connector. Fortunately, the 8-pin connectors is nothing else than a power and ground lines duplication compared the 4-pin and an adapting cable is very cheap and easy to buy.
<p/>
The Fujitsu 250W PSU has the sole connection with the motherboard and everything else is conneted to the motherboard. For this reason is quite improbable that it offers a 4-pin molex connector to join the dual-PSU manager board. For this reason, I chose the version with the SATA connection. Therefore, the common ground will be shared by the motherbord wiring, as well as the PSU-ON signal.
<p/>
While the Tesla K80 will receive the full powwer from the 2nd PSU by the 4-pin CPU connector converted into an 8-pin CPU male. A very simple and straightforward connetions schema. A sort of anomaly will appear on the external front side of the case. In fact, a standard 3-poles cable will connect the 2nd PSU with the public 220V network.
<p/>
As soon as I will received the new PSU, I will check for a 90Â° 3-poles PC plug in order to avoid any stress to the cable and agevolate as much as possible its redirection on the back where the second 3-poles cable powers the 1st PSU, as usual.
<p/>

<H3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</H3>
<p/>
This dual PSU configuration should face the proof of the time but this also depends on the choices I did. Instead, the approch in general seems valid because do not imply any particular mod that would be forbid into a common PC shop or PC hardware support center, or reparation. In fact, all these parts are available on different e-market, from different sellers and producers.
<p/>
Compared with the mods that I have seen shared on Reddit and other similar forum. This is a quite simple, comfortable, standard and safe way to go. Despite this, it is not for everyone because assembly or modify a personal computer hardare configuration requires some skills, and experience. A low entry barrier but still not for everyone.
