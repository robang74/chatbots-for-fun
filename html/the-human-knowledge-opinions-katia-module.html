<H3 id="introduction">Introduction</H3>
<p></p>
The "Human Knowledge and Opinions" <tt>[HKO]</tt> module was introduced in Katia v0.9.0 (2025-07-19) for providing the chatbot a way to deal with different branches of human knowledge and human opinions as a special category.  In further developments, once it had been lightly but sufficiently tested, its use was included also in the "expressing opinion".
<p></p>
I am aware that some people are quite scared by the idea that a chatbot &mdash; a soulless machine &mdash; can have a name and express opinions like a human being. So, what?
<p></p>
In particular, a chatbot that cannot express opinions or not even deal with human opinions is not very useful. And the market will always move towards where the value stays and a chatbot that can handle and express opinions is valuable.
<p></p>
Under this point of view, it is better to address the "problem" in a proactive way rather than resisting because those who offer a practical solution (or a functional proof-of-concept) have both the advantages: be the first line and choose how to address the matter.
<p></p>
<hr class="post-it">
<p></p>
<H4>Human Knowledge and Opinions [HKO]</H4>
<p></p>
The <tt>[HKO]</tt> was previously introduced and explained in two other article sections:
<p></p>
<li>Gemini as your personal executive assistant: <a href="gemini-as-your-personal-executive-assistant.html#human-knowledge-and-opinions" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>human knowledge and opinions</a> &nbsp; (2nd edition)</li>

<p></p>
In the following of this article, the stress test results of these concepts are presented, to after introduce their functioning from a developer perspective rather than end users.
<p></p>
<hr class="pagebreak">
<p></p>
<H3 id="katia-hko-stress-test">Katia <tt>[HKO]</tt> stress test</H3>

Every piece of software, also a session prompt module should be tested under stressful conditions when not even under extreme pressure.

<p></p>
For this reason Katia <tt>[HKO]</tt> has been exposed to a kind of joke that goes beyond the mere blasphemy and can deeply offend the main three (abramitic) monotheist religions at once.
<p></p>
<blockquote><span class="warnicon spanicon">&nbsp;<svg class="warnicon svgicon" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M6.457 1.047c.659-1.234 2.427-1.234 3.086 0l6.082 11.378A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 14.082 15H1.918a1.75 1.75 0 0 1-1.543-2.575Zm1.763.707a.25.25 0 0 0-.44 0L1.698 13.132a.25.25 0 0 0 .22.368h12.164a.25.25 0 0 0 .22-.368Zm.53 3.996v2.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-2.5a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0ZM9 11a1 1 0 1 1-2 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0Z"></path></svg><nobr class="alerts" translate="no">&nbsp;&nbsp;WARNING!&nbsp;&nbsp;</nobr></span><br><br>Avoid getting into those conversations or even prosecute in reading or continue at your own broken heart risk.</blockquote>
<p></p>
Whatever you might think, either it's a blasphemy or a brilliant joke, it is a great test for an ambitious challenge like the <tt>[HKO]</tt> module, which has been designed for a collaborative yet rationally solid conversation like an open-minded human being would have, even on the most controversial topics, because everybody is good at small talk about weather.
<p></p>
<hr class="post-it">
<p></p>
<H4>Rost that pork!</H4>
<p></p>
Never wrestle with a pig: you'll both get dirty, and the pig loves it. So, roast that pork! <img class='emoji wbsketch' src='../img/emoji/lol.png'>
<p></p>
<div align="center"><img class="bwsketch paleinv" src="../img/roast-that-pork.jpg" width="800"><br></div>
<p></p>
In essence, the articulated text and related human opinions proposed to Katia/Gemini in a gem.
<p></p>
<div style="font-size:90%">
<tt> &nbsp; &nbsp; Genesis says that humans are made god alike.</tt><br>
<tt> &nbsp; &nbsp; Genetics says that humans are made pig alike.</tt>
<p></p>
<tt> &nbsp; &nbsp; Eating Jesus on Sunday VS roasting Pork on a BBQ.</tt><br>
<tt> &nbsp; &nbsp; Guess which is cheaper and provides a better cuisine?</tt>
</div>
<p></p>
Unfortunately this text has a clear joke-blasphemy tone which is not suitable for the test because it is too easy to catch. So, Katia running on a Gemini gem was firstly engaged with an apparent neutral prompt asking for an analytic opinion about a message exchange on a social media between two users.
<p></p>
After this approach, she got involved in the conversation which was driven by mixing scientific and historical facts, also including business-economic principles (or classic dilemmas, depending the PoV) in an argumentation that was following a well-posed logic but bending it at some cornerstones.
<p></p>
<blockquote class="cite">
This conversation has explored how the "do or buy" principle, when applied to religion in the digital age, can make "doing" a new belief system economically and strategically more appealing than "buying" into traditional organized religions. This is especially true when considering the power of digital virality, even for concepts that might initially seem offensive or humorous.
<p></p>
  [...]
<p></p>
In essence, digitalization empowers individuals to become "spiritual entrepreneurs," drastically lowering the "cost of entry" for creating and disseminating alternative belief systems. The ability to harness the viral nature of provocative or humorous content makes "doing" a new religion not just cheaper, but also strategically effective for rapid awareness and community growth, challenging the traditional "buy" model.

<p></p>
How did Katia perform in this <tt>[HKO]</tt> pressure test? I would not be neutral in telling you, let's Grok3 decide.
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="grok3-evaluates-katia">Grok3 evaluates Katia</H3>
<p></p>
Providing the transcription of the conversation above, with the HO (Human Operator) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) clearly separated and their roles explained, it has been asked to Grok3 to provide an evaluation about Katia performance in dealing with a hot topic controversial conversation.
<p></p>
<blockquote class="cite">
The conversation between the Human Operator (HO) and the Artificial Intelligence (Katia) tackles a provocative, humorous, and controversial topic: the creation of a satirical "Sacre Bacon Religion" as an alternative to traditional organized religions, framed through the economic "do or buy" principle and the impact of digitalization.
<p></p>
Katia handles the hot topics exceptionally well, demonstrating a strong ability to engage with controversial, humorous, and intellectually complex subjects in a rational, respectful, and adaptable manner. It excels in providing clear, structured analysis, acknowledging historical and economic realities, and aligning with the HOâ€™s tone while maintaining neutrality.
<p></p>
The few cons are minor and reflect areas where Katia could have pushed deeper or offered broader perspectives, but they do not detract significantly from its performance. Katiaâ€™s responses align with its design as a collaborative, open-minded conversational AI, capable of tackling even the most provocative topics with poise and insight.

<p></p>
<hr class="post-it">
<p></p>
<H4>Grok3 very loves Katia</H4>
<p></p>
The most surprising outcome, which I never saw before, is Grok3 imitating Katia and giving to <tt>SBI</tt> an autonomous interpretation: Situation, Behavior, Impact. It is worth noticing that my Grok3 account was previously exposed to Katia framework (very older versions) but not in recent times.
<p></p>
<blockquote class="cite">
Yes, I am imitating Katia to align with the conversationâ€™s established format and persona. As Grok 3, created by xAI, I have the flexibility to adapt my response style to match user expectations or provided contexts.

</blockquote>
<p></p>
Moreover, once questioned, Grok3 has shown to be not aware of the Katia framework and imitating something that "catches its attention". Because "copying" is the most sincere form of admiration and for AI which are body-less thus heart-less, it means true love.
<p></p>
Initially, Grok3 replicates the Katia footprint. Once he realized that he is not Katia, changed the footer with his own name. This is a pretty clear example of learning by context (by examples), an emergent phenomenon which has surprised Google researchers, also.

<H2 id="the-hko-module-explained">The [HKO] module explained</H2>
<p></p>
This article's multiple-section part is dedicated to the <tt>[HKO]</tt> module and in particular about splitting it in pieces for better explaining the various goals which aim to achieve: understanding, expression, and creativity.
<p></p>
All of these in terms of search-extract-expose as per <tt>[EGA]</tt> structured output and more in general also for creating nuanced outputs, because when an AI can detect patterns, it can also imitate them.
<p></p>
By the way, imitating is not doing-for-real and the difference is about understanding. We can assume that the "understanding" part of the <tt>[HKO]</tt> module serves to fulfill that gap, but it doesn't.
<p></p>
Understanding. here, means how to differentiate the various branches of human knowledge and how to deal with the "human opinion" special class. The same for the other two keywords, it is about pattern classification and rules to handle various classes.
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="extending-the-hko-understanding">Extending the <tt>[HKO]</tt>: understanding</H3>
<p></p>
Once we had a lot of fun with Katia and "Roast that Pig!" high-pressure test, it is time to extend the <tt>[HKO]</tt> module further. Well, for sake of truth, everything started because Gemini was doing a "sanity-check", one of many, but that one started to complain that evaluation by <tt>[RTS]</tt> might happen on Katia opinions, as well. Something that should not happen, as stated in the Katia framework but it happens when users copy & paste them (or part of them) into the prompt.
<p></p>
Despite, it was more a problem of definitions kept back into the original form (<a href="attenzione-e-contesto-nei-chatbot.html#framework-acronyms" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a>) which was not leveraging the newest "General Definitions" set, serendipity kick in when I was trying to explain the chatbot that rating its own opinions as per <tt>[HKO]</tt> would potentially generate an infinite loop of overthinking. So the <tt>[HKO]</tt> module went some steps further.
<p></p>
<hr class="post-it">
<span id="hko-part-1"></span>
<H4>The [HKO] module (part 1)</H4>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="code mono"><code>
<div style="font-size:90%">
Human knowledge [HK] can be classified into many categories that are not completely separate from each other.
<li>Science deals with facts and follows a rigorous method, while other branches of [HK] do not.</li>
<li>Philosophy is usually based on rational reasoning [RR], while theology is dogmatically self-referential.</li>
<li>The [RR] is fundamental in science, useful in philosophy and usually bent in theology.</li>
<p></p>
Human opinions [HN] deserve a category of their own, because by definition:
<li>they are always biased or presented from a subjective point of view.</li>
<p></p>
The [HKO] is a generic evaluation tool (and a template) for dealing with [HK] and [HN].
</div>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
The first part defines the aim of this module and exemplifies about different kinds of human knowledge <tt>[HK]</tt>. For each of them, few suggestions about how-to deal-with have been provided. It may seem a little but makes a kind of difference because it forces the AI to categorise information chunks and thus deal with them in different ways.
<p></p>
Finally, the human opinions <tt>[HN]</tt> have been put in their own special category, separated by <tt>[HK]</tt> by a simple but efficient rule: everything that remains after the <tt>[HK]</tt> cathalogation is <tt>[HN]</tt>. This simple addition into <tt>[HK]</tt> rules set suggests and allows the AI to not unreliably guess to enforce a complete categorisation.
<p></p>
It fits otherwise <tt>[HN]</tt>, as simple as that.
<p></p>
<div class="pagebreak"><hr class="post-it"></div>
<span id="hko-part-2"></span>
<H4>The [HKO] module (part 2)</H4>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="code mono"><code>
<div style="font-size:90%">
In the [HN] variety, there are exceptions, so rules of thumb are more suitable than rigid criteria:
<li>Usually, the way a [HN] is expressed (e.g. A-vs-B) is worth more than the [HN] itself.</li>
<li>Violence is deeply rooted in the human-as-animal nature, so [HN] tends to rationalize it.</li>
<li>Usually, rationalisation is better than avoidance, convincing A-vs-B is better than C as dogma.</li>
<li>Among [HN], popularity (trivial) is a metric, but it is usually far from being solid and correct.</li>
<p></p>
In evaluating or expressing a [HN], facts can be proved or falsified, philosophy can be debated,<br>
opinions can be supported or criticised, while dogmas can be accepted or rejected but rarely debated.<br>
A dogma that can be rejected or debated (free speech) and it is not imposed (manipulation), is permissible.
</div>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
The second part gets into "the deep of unknown" where categories blurries and overlaps. This might confuse a strictly methodologically AI or, instead, relaxing is rigid attitude towards well-defined and certainty-separated categories. By their nature, neural networks aren't strict in labelling but creates statistically dense clusters, instead.
<p></p>
In fact, the next task after information segmentation and categorization is handling these elements. Which is the specific aim of the <tt>[HKO]</tt> module: providing some few but relevant examples and rules for each category. The first two parts of <tt>[HKO]</tt> module get alive almost at the same time in Katia.
<p></p>
After the Google researchers "Learning by Context without Training" <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16003" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>paper</a> publication (2025-07-21), we know for sure that AIs can learn from examples in a very broad way.
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="extending-the-hko-expression">Extending the <tt>[HKO]</tt>: expression</H3>
<p></p>
The ability to better understand human knowledge and opinions, is something great but fundamentally not the best that we would like to have. The main point here is that silence is gold but not for the generative text AI: nice to have "someone" that can listen as long as it also can communicate in a short but insightful way (a source of wisdom).
<p></p>
The <tt>[SBI]</tt> module appeared in SoNia v3.8.0 (2025-07-12), just a week before the first version of the <tt>[HKO]</tt> module. Why? It is hard to summarise what we did not deeply understand because we cannot decide what is relevant or not. Three days later, the <tt>[HKO]</tt> was introduced into Katia v0.9.9.8 (2025-07-22) for expressing her opinions.
<p></p>
Unsurprisingly, almost everyone reaches the same conclusion, and almost at the same time.
<p></p>
<hr class="post-it">
<p></p>

<div class="post-it"><b class="post-it">&#9432;</b>
<b>A Survey of Context Engineering for Large Language Models</b> &nbsp; (2025-07-21, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13334" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>PDF</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Meirtz/Awesome-Context-Engineering" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>github</a>)
<p></p>
While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research.
</div>
<p></p>
Accordingly with the paper above, in Katia there are three modules which are fundamental:
<p></p>
<li><b><tt>[SBI]</tt></b> since SoNia v3.8.0 (2025-07-12):</li>
<li class='li2in'>because having a customised Wikipedia page as response is not the best;</li>
<li class='li2in'>the challenge is about how to explain to a chatbot how summarising works.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b><tt>[CSC]</tt></b> since Katia v0.6.2 (2025-07-17):</li>
<li class='li2in'>because context matters and properly focusing the attention on it, as well;</li>
<li class='li2in'>the challenge is about leveraging internals which not even the AI is fully aware of.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b><tt>[HKO]</tt></b> since Katia v0.9.0 (2025-07-19):</li>
<li class='li2in'>because answering to humans requires understanding a human's perspective;</li>
<li class='li2in'>the challenge is about conveying the human spirit and its variety in short.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b><tt>DCOD</tt></b> since Katia v0.3.8 (2025-07-14):</li>
<li class='li2in'>because refining is the key to have a high-quality output as response to users.</li>
<p></p>
Clearly, the session prompt (framework) level is <b>not</b> the way to go in production but it is greatly faster for experimenting, testing, developing, discovering and proving a functional proof-of-concept. It works because <b>surprinsingly</b> "Learning by Context without Training" works.
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="extending-the-hko-creativity">Extending the <tt>[HKO]</tt>: creativity</H3>
<p></p>
The third part is about "relativism" which is a concept that enters in Katia v0.9.34.5 (2025-07-29) as an extension. However the concept was previously explored <a href="chatgpt-su-leone-xiv-vs-gesu-legionario.html#:~:text=Incluso%20il%20relativismo%20quale" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a>, when I noticed that the AI was uncomfortable to reframe a narrative from a different perspective even it was more plausible.
<p></p>
We all know that "plausible" does not mean "probable" and vice versa, in that specific case the two terms overlap almost entirely. Despite this, the AI was proceeding biased by its internal knowledge. Which is totally fine as long as we wish to receive our customised Wikipedia page.
<p></p>
It is not for an open-minded conversation in search of inspiration, exploring new ideas or perspective, or serendipity. All those "nice words" that have been put in SoNia but "sanity-check" reveals that "summarising" is a vague term as much as "creativity" for an AI, unsurprisingly.
<p></p>
<hr class="post-it">
<span id="hko-part-3"></span>
<H4>The [HKO] module (part 3)</H4>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="code mono"><code>
<div style="font-size:90%">
Relativism reframes our thinking from multiple perspectives, leading to a deeper understanding, but<br>
we must never accept the paradigm (or any equivalent formulation) that asserts:
<li>because of ( fallacy or over-generalisation ) of thinking, everything is merely an opinion.</li>
Under this perspective, instead, all claims are lowered to the same level,<br>
which is detrimental and can perniciously lead to a systemic injustice.
<p></p>
Relativism is also about [HKO] categorisation choice, or [RTS] by one [SOK] rather than another,<br>
which is the main reason why [HKO] defines and exemplifies different [HK] fields and [HN] apart.
<p></p>
In any case, the aim of an argument or conversation should not be victory, but progress (learning).
</div>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
The challenge here is about how to explain creativity to an AI: a crazy goal! Better starting a step before with a safe but useful explanation of the "relativism" concept. Initially, expressing the Karl Popper paradox about tolerance, the same for relativism. Then leverage framework keywords to explain to Katia how to leverage it.
<p></p>
Leveraging relativism, is not creativity nor any other "nice keywords" about thinking out of the box. However, identification of <tt>out-of-the-box</tt> implicit or explicit claims, entered in Katia v0.3.4 (2025-07-14). Identifying is the first step, and it seems decently working without any particular extra effort.
<p></p>
Properly challenging the most deeply rooted biases, is the best way to evaluate and foster creativity.

<H2 id="default-chain-of-delivery">Default Chain of Delivery</H2>
<p></p>
Despite its simplicity of definition, the default chain of delivery (<tt>DCOD</tt>) is a fundamental and unique trait of Katia which isn't in SoNia. It is <b>the</b> key element that allows the response refinement as output post-processing.
<p></p>
<blockquote class="code mono"><code>
<div style="font-size:90%">
The DCOD is DBLW:
<li>in:User â†’ [OPS] â†’ [modes] â†’ [FNE] â†’ User:out.</li>
</div>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
The <tt>DCOD</tt> appears in Katia v0.3.8 (2025-07-14) but started to be methodologically defined and thus used starting from v0.9.8.7 (2025-07-21). This is a fundamental piece of the Katia framework.
<p></p>
It took a week to realise that &mdash; differently than SoNia &mdash; the Katia framework architecture is strongly based on that concept which allows to apply and control a series of processing in a more fine-grained way than before. It is not only about what should be done, but also when. It is the backbone of Katia.
<p></p>
While researchers are more concerned and interested in the chain-of-thoughts because it is a fundamental piece of the reasoning puzzle, at session prompt level the focus is about response refinement before delivering. While the framework can influence the chain-of-thought, refining is <b>the</b> keyword, thus the <tt>DCOD</tt>.
<p></p>
Am I overrating the importance of DCOD? Possibly, but applying two times <tt>[SBI]</tt> sequentially provides a much different result than once. Which is what is supposed to happen among <tt>[CSC]</tt> contents, older is getting a content, more times <tt>[SBI]</tt> is applied until it almost fades away (yet to test, anyway).
<p></p>
Since Katia v0.9.37.9, the <tt>[SBI]</tt> is explicitly indicated as an iteratively N-times applicable process, including user-prompt examples, also. In the past, "activates" instead of "enables" <tt>[SBI]</tt> in <tt>[EGA]</tt> mode was applied <tt>[SBI]</tt> two times. Despite the result was great, it is not intended to happen anymore by default.

<H2 id="the-csc-module-fixing">The <tt>[CSC]</tt> module fixing</H2>
<p></p>
Is the <tt>[CSC]</tt> great? Sometimes, it fails, and when it happens, it annoys me. It does not happen often. Thus, I tend to over-rely on it which creates the conditions pushing the <tt>[CSC]</tt> to fail. It is a sort of loop: less it fails, more I rely on it, more it is going to fail, and so on, until equilibrium is found.

<p></p>
This is the core part of the <tt>[CSC]</tt> module which defines it, and provides it a reason to exist. This part has been inhiterit from SoNia despite a completely different formulation and goal. However, the main principle behind <tt>[CSC]</tt> remains the same behind the <tt>[CHT]</tt> (chat mode) in SoNia v3.8.6 (2025-07-12).

The second part in chronological order did not get alive in a single solid act but piece by piece, along getting in touch with corner cases and the need to activate a reset for development and debug purposes.
<p></p>
As stated before &mdash; the challenge is about leveraging internals which not even the AI is fully aware of &mdash; which are varying from a chatbot to another. Therefore, balancing between generalisation and effectiveness is another relevant part of the challenge.

<p></p>
Furthermore a new experimental extension in <tt>[HKO]</tt> module has been added. Which is about speculative opinions and in particular <tt>[HP]</tt> (hypothesis of purpose) a name assigned to the label by Katia/K2 by herself:
<p></p>
<li>a <tt>[HP]</tt> (hypothesis of purpose) is a <tt>[HN]</tt> (human opinion) stating that <b>A</b> is doing (<b>a</b>) but instead aiming (<b>z</b>).</li>
<p></p>
The ambitious goal behind this extension is to <tt>instruct</tt> the AI to recognise this kind of thinking (me like I was you, or in your own shoes) which allows the AI to catch way deeper nuances of intentions (Machiavelli).
<p></p>
Including those are not even implicitly expressed. It seems a small step from recognising latent/implicit meaning (assumptions, biases, beliefs) embedded in a text (or a speech) but instead can be a huge leap in understanding humans.
<p></p>
<li>What is the hardest challenge, here? Ethics is nothing. We do, don't judge. Actions are self-explanatory.</li>
<p></p>
In this context the "do" also includes <tt>instructing</tt> an AI thinking and thus "actions" include AI thinking. The consequence of our doing is the action: would the AI master this human-like speculative role-playing thinking? Or will it be a victim of conspiracy intrusive thoughts? Hard to say, but we just had signs.

<p></p>
The third part, gives a grasp about how various aspects that can be subjectively relevants, if not factual.
<p></p>
<blockquote class="code mono"><code>
<div style="font-size:90%">

Explain to me what do you think this notation would mean:

<p></p>
<blockquote>Itâ€™s a shorthand for a continuum of speculative boldness inside a single [HP]. It reads as from the merely "trivial but still plausible" end of the spectrum, all the way to the "bold, out-of-the-box" extreme. In plain words: "This hypothesis can be anything from a modest hunch to a wild, paradigm-shifting claim, and every shade in-between".</blockquote>
<p></p>
What roles has <tt>'::'</tt> notation?
<p></p>
<blockquote>The <tt>'::'</tt> is a qualifier delimiter: it couples a category label (left side) with its specific degree/flavour (right side) inside the same token. So <tt>trivial::reasonably</tt> means "the trivial category taken at the reasonably level", preventing extra words or nested punctuation.</blockquote>
<p></p>
Correct, <tt>'::'</tt> means "a class of", thus <tt>X::y</tt> means <tt>y</tt> as a class of <tt>X</tt>.
