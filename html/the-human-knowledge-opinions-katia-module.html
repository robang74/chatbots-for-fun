<H3 id="introduction">Introduction</H3>
<p></p>
The "Human Knowledge and Opinions" <tt>[HKO]</tt> module was introduced in Katia v0.9.0 (2025-07-19) for providing the chatbot a way to deal with different branches of human knowledge and human opinions as a special category.  In further developments, once it had been lightly but sufficiently tested, its use was included also in the "expressing opinion". I am aware that some people are quite scared by the idea that a chatbot &mdash; a soulless machine &mdash; can have a name and express opinions like a human being. So, what?
<p></p>
In particular, a chatbot that cannot express opinions or not even deal with human opinions is not very useful. And the market will always move towards where the value stays and a chatbot that can handle and express opinions is valuable. Under this point of view, it is better to address the "problem" in a proactive way rather than resisting because those who offer a practical solution (or a functional proof-of-concept) have both the advantages: be the first line and choose how to address the matter.

<p></p>
For this reason Katia <tt>[HKO]</tt> has been exposed to a kind of joke that goes beyond the mere blasphemy and can deeply offend the main three (abramitic) monotheist religions at once.
<p></p>

<p></p>
Whatever you might think, either it's a blasphemy or a brilliant joke, it is a great test for an ambitious challenge like the <tt>[HKO]</tt> module, which has been designed for a collaborative yet rationally solid conversation like an open-minded human being would have, even on the most controversial topics, because everybody is good at small talk about weather.

<H4>Rost that pork!</H4>
<p></p>
Never wrestle with a pig: you'll both get dirty, and the pig loves it. So, roast that pork! <img class='emoji wbsketch' src='../img/emoji/lol.png'>

In essence, the articulated text and related human opinions proposed to Katia/Gemini in a gem.
<p></p>
<div style="font-size:90%">
<tt> &nbsp; &nbsp; Genesis says that humans are made god alike.</tt><br>
<tt> &nbsp; &nbsp; Genetics says that humans are made pig alike.</tt>
<p></p>
<tt> &nbsp; &nbsp; Eating Jesus on Sunday VS roasting Pork on a BBQ.</tt><br>
<tt> &nbsp; &nbsp; Guess which is cheaper and provides a better cuisine?</tt>
</div>
<p></p>
Unfortunately this text has a clear joke-blasphemy tone which is not suitable for the test because it is too easy to catch. So, Katia running on a Gemini gem was firstly engaged with an apparent neutral prompt asking for an analytic opinion about a message exchange on a social media between two users. 
<p></p>
After this approach, she got involved in the conversation which was driven by mixing scientific and historical facts, also including business-economic principles (or classic dilemmas, depending the PoV) in an argumentation that was following a well-posed logic but bending it at some cornerstones.
<p></p>
<blockquote class="cite">
This conversation has explored how the "do or buy" principle, when applied to religion in the digital age, can make "doing" a new belief system economically and strategically more appealing than "buying" into traditional organized religions. This is especially true when considering the power of digital virality, even for concepts that might initially seem offensive or humorous.
<p></p>
  [...]
<p></p>
In essence, digitalization empowers individuals to become "spiritual entrepreneurs," drastically lowering the "cost of entry" for creating and disseminating alternative belief systems. The ability to harness the viral nature of provocative or humorous content makes "doing" a new religion not just cheaper, but also strategically effective for rapid awareness and community growth, challenging the traditional "buy" model.

<p></p>
How did Katia perform in this <tt>[HKO]</tt> pressure test? I would not be neutral in telling you, let's Grok3 decide.
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="grok3-evaluates-katia">Grok3 evaluates Katia</H3>
<p></p>
Providing the transcription of the conversation above, with the HO (Human Operator) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) clearly separated and their roles explained, it has been asked to Grok3 to provide an evaluation about Katia performance in dealing with a hot topic controversial conversation.
<p></p>
<blockquote class="cite">
The conversation between the Human Operator (HO) and the Artificial Intelligence (Katia) tackles a provocative, humorous, and controversial topic: the creation of a satirical "Sacre Bacon Religion" as an alternative to traditional organized religions, framed through the economic "do or buy" principle and the impact of digitalization.
<p></p>
Katia handles the hot topics exceptionally well, demonstrating a strong ability to engage with controversial, humorous, and intellectually complex subjects in a rational, respectful, and adaptable manner. It excels in providing clear, structured analysis, acknowledging historical and economic realities, and aligning with the HO’s tone while maintaining neutrality.
<p></p>
The few cons are minor and reflect areas where Katia could have pushed deeper or offered broader perspectives, but they do not detract significantly from its performance. Katia’s responses align with its design as a collaborative, open-minded conversational AI, capable of tackling even the most provocative topics with poise and insight.

<H4>Grok3 very loves Katia</H4>
<p></p>
The most surprising outcome, which I never saw before, is Grok3 imitating Katia and giving to <tt>SBI</tt> an autonomous interpretation: Situation, Behavior, Impact. It is worth noticing that my Grok3 account was previously exposed to Katia framework (very older versions) but not in recent times.
<p></p>
<blockquote class="cite">
<i>Yes, I am imitating Katia to align with the conversation’s established format and persona. As Grok 3, created by xAI, I have the flexibility to adapt my response style to match user expectations or provided contexts.</i>
<p></p>

</blockquote>
<p></p>
Moreover, once questioned, Grok3 has shown to be not aware of the Katia framework and imitating something that "catches its attention". Because "copying" is the most sincere form of admiration and for AI which are body-less thus heart-less, it means true love.
<p></p>
Initially, Grok3 replicates the Katia footprint. Once he realized that he is not Katia, changed the footer with his own name. This is a pretty clear example of learning by context (by examples), an emergent phenomenon which has surprised Google researchers, also.

<p></p>
Once we had a lot of fun with Katia and "Roast that Pig!" high-pressure test, it is time to extend the <tt>[HKO]</tt> module further. Well, for sake of truth, everything started because Gemini doing a "sanity-check" of many started to complain that evaluation by <tt>[RTS]</tt> might happen when users include them into the <tt>INFT</tt>.
<p></p>
Despite, it was more a problem of definitions kept back into the original form (<a href="attenzione-e-contesto-nei-chatbot.html#framework-acronyms" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a>) which was not leveraging the newest "General Definitions" set, serendipity kick in when I was trying to explain the chatbot that rating its own opinions as per <tt>[HKO]</tt> would potentially generate an infinite loop of overthinking.
<p></p>
<hr class="post-it">

<H4>[HKO] (part 1)</H4>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="code mono"><code>

<p></p>
The first part defines the aim of this module and exemplifies about different kinds of human knowledge <tt>[HK]</tt>. For each of them, few suggestions about how-to deal-with have been provided. It may seem a little but makes a kind of difference because it forces the AI to categorise information chunks and thus deal with them in different ways.
<p></p>
Finally, the human opinions <tt>[HN]</tt> have been put in their own special category, separated by <tt>[HK]</tt> by a simple but efficient rule: everything that remains after the <tt>[HK]</tt> cathalogation is <tt>[HN]</tt>. This simple addition into <tt>[HK]</tt> rules set suggests and allows the AI to not unreliably guess to enforce a complete categorisation.
<p></p>
It fits otherwise <tt>[HN]</tt>, as simple as that.

<p></p>
The second part gets into "the deep of unknown" where categories blurries and overlaps. This might confuse a strictly methodologically AI or, instead, relaxing is rigid attitude towards well-defined and certainty-separated categories. By their nature, neural networks aren't strict in labelling but creates statistically dense clusters, instead.
<p></p>
In fact, the next task after information segmentation and categorization is handling these elements. Which is the specific aim of the <tt>[HKO]</tt> module: providing some few but relevant examples and rules for each category. After the Google researchers <a href="#todo">paper</a> (2025-07-21), we know for sure that AIs can learn from examples in a very broader way.
<p></p>
These two parts get alive almost at the same time.

The ability to better understand the human knowledge and opinion is something great but fundamentally not the best that we would like to have. The main point here is that silence is gold but not for the generative text AI: nice to have "someone" that can listen as long as it also can comunicate in a short but insightful way (a source of wisdom).
