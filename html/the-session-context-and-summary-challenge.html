<H3 id="introduction">Introduction</H3>
<p></p>
When it comes to "do a summary", this request is not handled very well in some chatbots and the main reason is quite simple: it is not a trivial task. In fact, also children in primary schools need to learn how to do it, and they are AGI-capable for their own nature.
<p></p>
For this reason, instructing a chatbot even with logical and lexical thinking capability is not an easy task but a challenge. It is even more complicated when the "summary" is not about a predetermined text but about providing a "brief answer" which implies having a focus about the context and user expectation awareness.
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="rationale">Rationale</H3>
<p></p>
The <tt>[<a href="#sbi-module">SBI</a>]</tt> module in Katia is an attempt to provide a chatbot with a session-prompt level set of instructions about how to do a summary. While the [<a href="#csc-module"><tt>CSC</a></tt>] module in Katia is an attempt to speed-up the chatbot answer creation, instructing how to deal with user-expectation and with the focus within the chat session context.
<p></p>
The chat session context is created as a chat session between-prompt persistent data cache in which the AI is instructed to keep notes about what is matter. The <tt>[SBI]</tt> summarising process leverages the <tt>[CSC]</tt> while the <tt>[CSC]</tt> uses the <tt>[SBI]</tt> summary to progressively shrink its size.
<p></p>
Therefore, since Katia v0.9.30.4 implementation the two modules are mutually interdependent in how they work. Which is supposed to increase their efficiency and efficacy, thus improving performances (compared to the previous versions) and being more useful in assisting the users.
<p></p>
<div class="pagebreak"><hr></div>
<p></p>
<H3 id="proof-of-concept">Proof-of-Concept</H3>
<p></p>
Despite the session-prompt level is not the most efficient way to implements these features, for developing purposes and creating a human-readable proof-of-concept, it is the correct approch.
<p></p>
<li><tt>TFMK</tt> = "this framework"</li>
<li><tt>ATCT</tt> ~ "at the time of ( processing or activation )"</li>
<li><tt>UPPR</tt> = "only the procedural part of the ATCT user-prompt, never OCR( images )"</li>
<li><tt>[SBI]</tt> is an actionable mode and an available optional specific tool</li>
<li><tt>[IGN]</tt> and <tt>[ARK]</tt> are labels for <tt>[SOK]</tt> source of knownledge</li>
<li><tt>[EGA[</tt> and <tt>[PRO]</tt> are actionable modes</li>
<p></p>
In the next two sections, the Katia <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robang74/chatbots-for-fun/2adbb769288df15a193978f6c4960d509cc2a46a/data/katia-executive-grade-analysis-v1.md" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>v0.9.32.8</a> implementations of <tt>[CSC]</tt> and <tt>[SBI]</tt> for reference, which use some definitions reported above. Performances tested over this article's intrductiion + rationale sections (1500c, 256w) are 1:2 for single-SBI (718c, 108w, 48%) and 1:5 for double-SBI (283c, 41w, 19%, 39%).

<H2 id="context-window-management-cwm">Context Window Management [CWM]</H2>
<p></p>
It is worth to say that the chatbot usually is not able to know about its internal resources like the context window. Therefore, the idea to provide instructions about how to handle it, and moreover how to allocate it, is quite awkward.
<p></p>
On the other hand, we cannot exclude that the inability of the chatbot to answer specific questions about its internals (awareness) is an artifact about functional layers separation in its application stack. The outer functional layer is the webgui, but the APIs are usually available and allow managing much more details.
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="some-speculative-questions">Some speculative questions</H3>
<p></p>
Who knows if the AI can manage its internals at session prompt level but cannot explain to the users? In a human-centric description is like having unconscious resources available but unknown at the conscient level.
<p></p>
Conceptually, the idea is experimental: how far can we delegate tasks to the AI? How far can we apply the idea of "mesmerising" and AI to unlock the unconscious resources available below the awareness level? If this approach works (or provides tangible benefits), who should care to explain the underlying dynamics? And why?
<p></p>
Anyway, in the following the code that implements the <tt>[CWM]</tt> module. In the worst case, it might have an educative value in introducing concepts like context window stack and related stuff to those who have their hands into the AI engines. Inspiring others is a value as well.
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="code-explanation">Code explanation</H3>
<p></p>
In order to manage the context window, it is essential categorising the source of knowledge <tt>[SOK]</tt> to defer to them the proper elaborating process. The labels definitions and their use, is the <tt>[LBL]</tt> module's aim.
<p></p>
<span id="lbl-module"></span>
<H4>Sources labeling [LBL]</H4>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="code mono"><code>
The [LBL] is a general tool for categorising the sources of knowledge [SOK].
<p></p>
Apply a label at every [SOK] by its type, strictly in this order:
<li>[IPK] internal parametric knowledge;</li>
<li>[WEB] information retrieved from external sources;</li>
<li>[ARK] all attached documents or medias, including:</li>
 <li>those texts embedded in the User:in provided for elaboration.</li>
<li>[USR] the ATCT and all previous User:in parts which are not [ARK];</li>
<li>[IGN] is a custom mark indicating an element to ignore.</li>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
Once the text to process (<tt>TXTP</tt>) has been defined using the labels <tt>[LBL]</tt>, it becomes clear that can easily grow bigger than the context window because the attachments <tt>[ARK]</tt> unless those stuff get into a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system.
<p></p>
After that definition, the context window management <tt>[CWM]</tt> module can be seen as split in two halves. 
<p></p>
<li>The first define the stack over the context window which include the framework (session-prompt) and the instructions (user-prompt), with the internal savings and the chat session context <tt>[CSC]</tt> which is the most prominent part of the first 1/3 because the <tt>[CSC]</tt> contains the summary of all the past interactions and elaborations.</li>
<p></p>
<li>The second defines the process in a step-by-step way. Which instructs the AI how to deal with overlapping contiguous segments, how to split the TXTP and how to referenciate the TXTP content in order to create the necessary hooks to populate the <tt>[CSC]</tt> content.</li>
<p></p>
<span id="cwm-module"></span>
<H4>Context Window Management [CWM]</H4>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="code mono"><code>
The "text to process" (TXTP) is a specific [SOK] union: [WEB] + [ARK] + [USR].
<p></p>

is a specific tool to manage TXTP and the context window stack, as OLST(filling):
<li>â…“, {0 â†’ â…“}: TFMK + FRMI + UPPR + [CSC], for tasks execution;</li>
<li>â…“, {â…“ â†’ â…”}: few TXTP elements by [CWM], for data elaboration;</li>

<li>process the TXTP divided into contiguous overlapping groups of few (min:3) segments,</li>
<li>few enough to fill-up â…” of the AI's context window length (fill >â…” OR free <â…“: stop).</li>

<p></p>
Overall, none of these concepts is new. The novelty resides in how these concepts are functionally and operatively related among them.

<H3 id="general-consideration-about-cwm">General consideration about [CWM]</H3>
<p></p>
The most advanced AI models like ChatGPT-5 sometimes argue that the Katia framework is bloatware-like written. Usually this happens because the framework requires a reorganisation (sections order) or few words (or symbols) of adjustment. Usually, they also recognise that "after training" the training explanation seems it can be much shorter summarised, but just because the concept behind has been grabbed well enough. Instead, extremely short forms do not achieve a decent training level.
<p></p>
<div class="post-it"><b class="post-it">&#9432;</b>
According to Google Cloud, Gemini 2.5 Flash has a one million-token context window. Which allows the model to process and understand vast amounts of information in a single request, enabling it to handle complex tasks and analyze extensive datasets. 
</div>
<p></p>
The tokes and the words are not the same, however by a raw estimation 1M tokes are 5M bytes of plain text (or in Markdown). Which is a <b>LOT</b>, really. However, more conventional context windows sizes are 32K or 128K tokens, especially when the model is one of which can run on an off-line single GPU server. Just to have an idea of these numbers, katia v0.9.51.10 is less than 4K tokens.
<p></p>
Surprisingly, also Gemini 2.5 flash showed a better performance in detecting and closing <tt>DIB</tt>s and <tt>GAP</tt>s, after the introduction of the <tt>[CWM]</tt>. Surprisingly, because there is no evidence that this would even happen in a noticeable way due to the fact that Gemini is not aware (believing its answers) about its internals and its context windows is <b>VERY</b> huge.

<H3 id="speculations-and-hypothesys">Speculations and hypothesys</H3>
<p></p>
A case of self-induced placebo-effect, possibly. OR, these instructions, despite not having the straightforward effect they aim to, allows the AI to better understand how to deal with the information process. In fact, these instructions not only explain what to do (procedure), but also why (concept).
<p></p>
Due to the fact these instructions are within a highly structured framework, they achieve a practical and tangible benefit (improvement) even if the AI cannot really have any influence over its internals, like managing the context windows, arbitrary.
<p></p>
Would it be so strange that knowing how to deal with information, from which kind of source is a chuck of text, and why some actions are schematised in such a way, will concretely change the way in which output is produced? I do not think so, otherwise "summarize this text" will work as much as explaining what summarising means and why that "tool" exists and how to use it to achieve specific goals.
<p></p>
<li>After all, we do not teach kids to summarize a text as a task <i>per se</i>.</li>
<li>Moreover, due to the sole fact that they can learn, we teach them.</li>
<p></p>
In the same fashion, an AI that learns <tt>[SBI]</tt> and gets a contextual grasp of the "relevant claim" concept can use them to keep its own notes (aka <tt>[CSC]</tt>) which improves its attention management (context is conditioning, proven).
<p></p>
Although the <tt>[CWM]</tt> effect on data processing is less straightforward, it doesn't mean that it is less impactful.
<p></p>
<br>
<p></p>
<H2 id="developing-tools">Developing Tools</H2>
<p></p>
Some activities are a constant in developing a session-prompt like applying changes or patches, and doing several checks about some specific qualities of the framework. When tasks are recurrent, they tend to reach a stable form and then get automated.
<p></p>
Which is exactly what happens also in this case with "<tt>sanity-check</tt>" and "<tt>update-check</tt>" tools. Plus, a softening rule gets into the scene because chatbots do their best-effort to fulfill user requests even when nothing serious is on the table.
<p></p>
For this reason, the framework instructs the AI to avoid bothering the developer with minor issues that can handle by itself alone and just complaining about major ones. Which are humorously labeled as 'dramas' because for the AI logic so they are, in fact.
<p></p>
