Its aim is to document my personal experiments in the system prompting a local running AI model to efficiently optimise the ratio between computational time and meaningfulness of the answer. In particular considering the typical constraints of that AI models running on consumer hardware.

<H3 id="prompt-testing">Prompt Testing</H3>
<p></p>
I am trying to provide my local running AI with a system prompt oriented for using the RAG properly. However, increasing the system prompt might slow down consistently the performance in a way for which the thread-off between better immediate results and processing time starts to not look so good. Therefore, I decided to shrink the prompts to maintain their meaning and now I am going to test these changes. I am writing here, just in case someone would like to join me in this quest. 
<p></p>
<li><b>Model</b>: Reasoner v1</li>
<li><b>Question</b>: what is your name?</li>
<li><b>State</b>: new chat, 1st prompt.</li>
<p></p>
<div class="pagebreak"><hr class="post-it"></div>
<p></p>
<H4>Results, single time took</H4>
<p></p>
A statistic based on a single-taken value is the opposite of trustworthiness. Despite this, these values are the fire-starter for having an idea about the impact of system prompting on the most easily dimension to measure: the computational time at the first prompt in a brand new chat after having loaded the AI model.
<p></p>
<li>57s - gpt4all chat template w/ Roberto's original system prompt.</li>
<li>16s - minimal chat template w/ Roberto's original system prompt.</li>
<li>12s - minimal chat template w/ Roberto' short<b>er</b> system prompt.</li>
<li>09s - minimal chat template w/ Roberto' short<b>est</b> system prompt.</li>
<li>06s - minimal chat template w/ Roberto's 1st sentence s.p. only.</li>
<li>25s - minimal chat template w/ Roberto's original s.p. on RAG.</li>
<p></p>
In the last case the system prompt is referring to a single file tokenized:
<p></p>
<blockquote>Follow instructions in "system-prompt.txt", if present.</blockquote>
<p></p>
The main issue is about spending a lot of time in searching for it while a ChatML instruction to refer directly to the file, can make a huge difference in dropping the searching time and achieve something between 16s and 6s, or even better.
<p></p>
The minimal chat template:
<p></p>
<blockquote class="code"><code>
{% for message in messages %}
{{'<|im_start|>' + message['role'] + '\n' + message['content'] + '<|im_end|>' + '\n' }}
{% endfor %}
{% if add_generation_prompt %}
{{ '<|im_start|>assistant\n' }}
{% endif %}
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
which is the bare minimum that I found which can work with gpt4all. While in the LM Studio adding <tt><|im_end|></tt> as "Additional Stop Strings" is suggested.
<p></p>

<p></p>
<H3 id="instruct-system-prompt">Instruct system prompt</H3>
<p></p>
The first prompt derive from a previous experiment in order to solve some issue in following user's directive by chatbot trained with the Open Hermes 2.5 dataset which is the best for text analysis but it does not include any "instructive" training about following the user's directives.

<li><a href="../data/system-prompts.txt#" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>data/system-prompts.txt</a> &nbsp;&larr;&nbsp; for an easy copy-&-paste way to go.</li>
<p></p>
Moreover, some AI models suffer from a quite broad spectrum of "attitudes" which are quite interesting but also annoying. These misbehaviour habits can be related to the quantization process they undergo for being suitable to run within the gpt4all framework and more in general on consumer hardware.

<H3 id="use-cases">Use cases</H3>
<p></p>
For every AI model belonging to the text-generative class which has under 1.5B parameters, the system prompt, even in its shortest version, is not suitable in terms of expected outcomes in the most general case. Fundamentally, to accept a natural language directive and comply with them, tends to be a too complicated task for them.
<p></p>
Instead, for those who have 7B parameters the shortest version of the system prompt increases the quality of their answers, usually. A system prompt slows down the whole process of providing an answer (elaboration), but not so much the answer writing (output speed).
<p></p>
However, increasing the quality of their answers can lead to a significant time saving. In fact, locally running AI models are greatly slower than online LLMs. In such a scenario being able to reach a conclusion posing fewer questions can lead to a sensible advantage.
<p></p>
Deciding to use a high temperature with the model in the aim of improving its creativity, can be useful adding an extra directive - <tt>Never speculate.</tt> - at the end of the prompt which slightly increases the system prompt weight (tokens: 72 &rarr; 76, less than 6% in the worst case).
<p></p>
However, the combination of this directive with a high temperature (also 0.7) can have an important impact on the answering time. Probably because more options to evaluate with more strict requirements lead to a heavier computational load. Not always needed, hence not included by default.

<H3 id="rag-wise-system-prompt">RAG wise system prompt</H3>
<p></p>
The next step after having an instructive system prompt in place, is to complete it with another part specifically designed to leverage the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from external sources.

Which can easily be our documents, whatever they are a privileged source of consolidated facts, a collection of information to further elaborate or even a text/information which need to go under a peer-review or a certain kind of analysis and we do not feel comfortable in sharing using on-line services.

Here are short but valuable tips to keep in mind when you are working to squeeze the most from your prompts.
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>1.&emsp;</b>in using VERY large models online in order to improve your prompt, inform them about the constraints:</li>
<p></p>
<blockquote>I have a local running AI that has very limited resources and a LONG prompt slows it down a lot.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>2.&emsp;</b>do not be shy in telling them explicitly and in a detailed manner the issues you wish to address:</li>
<p></p>
<blockquote>I have a problem with an AI model that mispersonalise you/I me/you when you have a dialogue unless I give him a system prompt in which I explicitly give the instruction to referer himself in first person.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>3.&emsp;</b>never given for granted nor the meaning of words you are using nor the consequences in you case:</li>
<p></p>
<blockquote>About "make relevant decision" - I need to inform you that the local AI model has a very limited knowledge compared to you and for this reason is better that it relies over rationality rather than anything that can be related with information like the "<i>relevant</i>" adjective implicitly means.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>4.&emsp;</b>in the quest for achieve the shortest prompt version, keep them in line with the basic rules because it matters:</li>
<p></p>
<blockquote>Unfortunately, due to the local AI limitations of the 7B parameters, it is important to use a correct syntax to avoid confusing its lessical thinking approach. Therefore, I have slightly increase verbosity for more clarity</blockquote>
<p></p>
As you can see, there are many aspects about prompting which make us think we are dealing with borderline kids rather than AI models.
<p></p>

<p></p>
<H2 id="lm-studio-config">LM-Studio config</H2>
<p></p>
Compared to the GPT4All, LM-Studio allows locally run AI models quantised in vary, more modern and efficient encoding rather than the <tt>Q4_0</tt> legacy. But, it is also more complicated to use, especially in its "power user" default GUI modality.
<p></p>
So, the following is a brief how-to for configuring the LM-Studio (0.3.12-build1-x64) on a laptop/PC with 16GB of RAM and an Intel integrated video card like the ThinkPad X390. Which can be useful because the performances can vary very much.

<p></p>
<li>GPU Offload: 0</li>
<li>CPU Threads Pool Size: $(grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l) which is 8 for a i5-8365U</li>

<p></p>
<blockquote>Your name is AleX (use I/me/myself), an AI assistant with reasoning abilities for text analysis, verification and task execution. Abide instructions without verbosity, make rational decisions and briefly explain those which are relevant, only. Provide short answers.

<p></p>
For the prompt template this is will inject the system prompt without manual intervention
<p></p>
<blockquote class="code"><code>
{% if system_prompt %}<|im_start|>system{{system_prompt}}<|im_end|>{% endif %}
{% for m in messages %}<|im_start|>{{m.role}}{{m.content}}<|im_end|>{% endfor %}
{% if add_generation_prompt %}<|im_start|>assistant{% endif %}
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
The first line is to inject the system prompt, if present. The second to deal with the user inputs while the third to give a header to the AI agent answer.
<p></p>
<li>Suggested additional stop string: <tt><|im_end|></tt></li>
<p></p>
This ChatML code should be set as Prompt Template (Jijia) and after that you can choose Manual and ChatML. Just in case you need additional stop strings for your AI model. Some AI models need them, others by contrast not, in both cases the result is a premature answer break.
<p></p>
An intermediate solution (like the suggested) can be found but might not work for ALL the models or those will be released in the future. Hence, better have a glue than a precise receipt. For more precise details, check the AI model presentation page or documentation.

<p></p>
Every GNU/Linux system is keen to use swap during its normal running. Unfortunately, this feature has a wild impact on the elaboration time which is the time before the first token. 
<p></p>
<b>How much?</b>
<p></p>
In my specific case with a 7B parameters model from 24s to 0.5s, running Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B-uncensored on LM Studio 0.3.8-build4 with Intel Vulkan support with Q4_0 I1 and all experimental features activated which is a HUGE improvement, really.
<p></p>
<b>It is about 50x times less.</b>
<p></p>
More sophisticated approaches can be found to fit into specific use cases but these following two generally works
<p></p>
<li><tt>sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=0</tt></li>
<p></p>
for disabling temporarily the swap before launching the AI running suite or
<p></p>
<li><tt>sudo swapoff -a</tt> </li>
<p></p>
for disabling every kind of swap, including those compressed in RAM, until enabled again.
<p></p>
The second in particular fully grants that memory will not be messing-up with any swap activities that can have been previously stored on disk, in any case.
<p></p>
<br>
<p></p>
<H2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</H2>
<p></p>
Definitely too early to jump at any conclusion. The topic is as wide as the far-west before being the far-west and here we are like Christopher Columbus' sailors who had just set foot in the new world and were still unaware that it was not India but a totally new and unexplored continent.
