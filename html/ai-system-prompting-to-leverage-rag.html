<p></p>
This paper is based on a <a href="https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all/discussions/3358#discussioncomment-11817710" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>comment</a> that I wrote on the discussion board on the GitHub Nomic AI gpt4all project. Its aim is to document my personal experiments in system prompting a local running AI model for efficiently optimise the ratio between computational time and meanfullness of the answer. In particular considering the typical constrains of that AI models running on consumer hardware.
<p></p>
<li>2nd edition (since rev. 7) contains a new section <a href="#use-cases">use cases</a> about when and how using system prompt in a productive manner. In particular: "<tt>Never speculate</tt>" as optional.</li>
<p></p>
<li>3rd edition (since rev. 8) contains a new section <a href="#the-swap-impact">the-swap impact</a> for boosting the elaboration time which is the time before the first answer token is going to be written.</li>

<H3 id="prompt-testing">Prompt Testing</H3>
<p></p>
I am trying to provided my local running AI with a system prompt oriented for using the RAG properly. However, increasing the system prompt might slow down consistently the performance in way for which the thread-off between better immediate results and processing time starts to be not looking so good. Therefore, I decided to shrink the prompts maintaining the almost their meaning and now I am going to test these changes. I am writing here, just in case someone would like to join me in this quest. 
<p></p>
<li><b>Model</b>: Reasoner v1</li>
<li><b>Question</b>: what is your name?</li>
<li><b>State</b>: new chat, 1st prompt.</li>
<p></p>
<hr class="post-it">
<p></p>
<H4>Results, single time took</H4>
<p></p>
A statistic based on a single-taken value is the opposite of trustwortiness. Despite this, these values are the fire-starter for having an idea about the impact of system prompting on the most easily dimension to measure: the computational time at the first prompt in a brand new chat after having loaded the AI model.
<p></p>
<li>57s - gpt4all chat template w/ Roberto's original system prompt.</li>
<li>16s - minimal chat template w/ Roberto's original system prompt.</li>
<li>12s - minimal chat template w/ Roberto' short<b>er</b> system prompt.</li>
<li>09s - minimal chat template w/ Roberto' short<b>est</b> system prompt.</li>
<li>06s - minimal chat template w/ Roberto's 1st sentence s.p. only.</li>
<li>25s - minimal chat template w/ Roberto's original s.p. on RAG.</li>
<p></p>
In the last case the system prompt is referring to a single file tokenized:
<p></p>
<blockquote>Follow instructions in "system-prompt.txt", if present.</blockquote>
<p></p>
The main issue is about spending a lot of time in searching for it while a ChatML instruction to refer directly to the file, can make a hude difference in dropping the searching time and achieve something between 16s and 6s, or even better.
<p></p>
The minimal chat temple:
<p></p>
<blockquote><tt>{% for message in messages %}</tt><br><tt>{{'<|im_start|>' + message['role'] + '\n' + message['content'] + '<|im_end|>' + '\n' }}</tt><br><tt>{% endfor %}</tt><br><tt>{% if add_generation_prompt %}</tt><br><tt>{{ '<|im_start|>assistant\n' }}</tt><br><tt>{% endif %}</tt></blockquote>
<p></p>
which is the bare minum that I found which can work with gpt4all. While in the LM Studio adding <tt><|im_end|></tt> as "Additional Stop Strings" is suggested.

<H3 id="instruct-system-prompt">Instruct system prompt</H3>
<p></p>
The first prompt derive from a previous experiment in order to solve some issue in following user's directive by chatbot trained with the Open Hermes 2.5 dataset which is the best for text analisys but it does not include any "instructive" training about following the user's directives.

<p></p>
Moreover, some AI model suffer of a quite broad spectrum of "attitudes" which are quite interesting but also annoying. These misbahaviourl habits can be related to the quantisitation process they undergo for being suitable to run within the gpt4all framework and more in general on consumer hardware.

<H3 id="use-cases">Use cases</H3>
<p></p>
For every AI model belonging to the text-generative class which has under 1.5B parameters, the system prompt, even in its shortest version, is not suitable in terms of expected outcomes in the most general case. Fundamentally, to accept a natural language directive and comply with them, tends to be a too complicated task for them.
<p></p>
Instead, for those who have 7B parameters the shortest version of the system prompt increases the quality of their answers, usually. A system prompt slows down the whole process of providing an answer (elaboration), but not so much the answer writing (output speed).
<p></p>
However, increasing the quality of their answers can lead to a significant time saving. In fact, locally running AI models are greatly slower than online LLMs. In such a scenario being able to reach a conclusion posing fewer questions can lead to a sensible advantage.
<p></p>
Deciding to use a high temperature with the model in the aim of improving its creativity, can be useful adding an extra directive - <tt>Never speculate.</tt> - at the end of the prompt which slightly increases the system prompt weight (tokens: 72 &rarr; 76, less than 6% in the worst case).
<p></p>
However, the combination of this directive with a high temperature (also 0.7) can have an important impact on the answering time. Probably because more options to evaluate with more strict requirements lead to a heavier computational load. Not always needed, hence not included by default.

<p></p>
The next step after having an instructive system prompt in place, is to complete it with another part specifically designed to leverage the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from external sources.

Which can easily be our documents, whatever they are a priviledged source of consolidated facts, a collection of information to further elaborate or even a text/information which need to go under a peer-review or a certain kind of analisys and we do not feel confortable in sharing using on-line services.

Here a short but valuable tips to keep in mind when you are working in squize the most from your prompts.
<p></p>
<li><b>1.<span style='visibility: hidden;'>--</span></b>in using VERY large models online in order to improve your prompt, inform them about the constrains:</li>
<p></p>
<blockquote>I have a local running AI has very limited resources and a LONG prompt slow it down a lot.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<li><b>2.<span style='visibility: hidden;'>--</span></b>do not be shy in telling them explicetely and in a detailed manner the issues you wish to address:</li>
<p></p>
<blockquote>I have a problem with an AI model that mispersonalise you/I me/you when have a dialogue unless I gave him a system prompt in which I explicitly give the instruction to referer himself in first person.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<li><b>3.<span style='visibility: hidden;'>--</span></b>never given for granted nor the meaninging of words you are using nor the conseguequences in you case:</li>
<p></p>
<blockquote>About "make relevant decision" - I need to inform you that the local AI model has a very limited knowledge compared to you and for this reason is better that it relies over rationality rather than anything that can be related with information like the "<i>relevant</i>" adjective implicitly means.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<li><b>4.<span style='visibility: hidden;'>--</span></b>in the quest for achieve the shortest prompt version, keep them in line with the basic rules becase it matters:</li>
<p></p>
<blockquote>Unfortunately, due the local AI limitations 7B parameters, it is important to use a correct syntax to avoid to confuse its lessical thinking approach. Therefore, I have slightly increase verbosity for more clarity</blockquote>
<p></p>
As you can see, there are many aspects about prompting which make us thinking we are dealing with borderline kids rather than AI models.

<H3 id="the-swap-impact">The swap impact</H3>
<p></p>
Every GNU/Linux system is keen to use swap during its normal running. Unfortunately, this feature has a wild impact on the elaboration time which is the time before the first token. 
<p></p>
<b>How much?</b>
<p></p>
In my specific case with a 7B parameters model from 24s to 0.5s, running Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B-uncensored on LM Studio 0.3.8-build4 with Intel Vulkan support with Q4_0 I1 and all experimental features activated which is a HUGE improvement, really.
<p></p>
<b>It is about 50x times less.</b>
<p></p>
More sophisticated approaches can be found to fit into specific use cases but these following two generally works
<p></p>
<li><tt>sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=0</tt></li>
<p></p>
for disabling temporarily the swap before launching the AI running suite or
<p></p>
<li><tt>sudo swapoff -a</tt> </li>
<p></p>
for disabling every kind of swap, including those compressed in RAM, until enabled again.
<p></p>
The second in particular fully grants that memory will not be messing-up with any swap activities that can have been previously stored on disk, in any case.
<p></p>
<br>
<p></p>
<H2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</H2>
<p></p>
Definetely too early to jump at any conclusion. The topic is as wide as the far-west before being the far-west and here we are like Christopher Columbus' sailors who had just set foot in the new world and were still unaware that it was not India but a totally new and unexplored continent.
