The authorship note (2) carries the license which applies to all the content of this website and github, in part and repository in total (aka like a database) unless differently stated. Also the operative definition (5) of the <tt>[SBI]</tt> mode is shared with <a href="../data/sonia-argumentative-with-rag-v3.txt#:~:text=Short%20but%20insightful" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>SoNia</a> argumentative session prompt.
<p></p>
Because SoNia is an entire framework which characterises an agent, in order to maintain the short-but-insightful instructions (5) unchanged, it is necessary to add an instructive sentence (4) before which works as adaptation for a generic chat session. The <tt>[SBI]</tt> activation by default is append at its end.
<p></p>
Therefore, the operative definition (7) of the <tt>[F&E]</tt> mode is the core part, which fits into a modular prompt structure. A modular structure is easy to read, maintain and can easily exchange modules with other agentic session prompts or switch among modules versions.

The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robang74/chatbots-for-fun/7a1c888ce3da8acce15b83001c8e7348a65c327c/data/juan-finance-economics-analysis-v1.txt#:~:text=Finance%20%26%20Economics%20%5BF%26E%5D" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>core</a> of the F&E prompt is divided in seven parts. While the last two parts are defining how various modes interact among them, and the first is the seed of an agentic AI prompt, the middle part (7.2 &mdash; 7.5) is the center of gravity of that module.
<p></p>
The attention and the context are two relevant elements that greatly influence how the AI reacts in processing data and reacts to the user inputs. Influencing these two aspects (7.2 &mdash; 7.3) is what can be described as "sticking the AI to a focused task".
<p></p>
The keywords in the F&E module are just three: <tt>Juan</tt>, <tt>finance-economics</tt> and <tt>[F&E]</tt>. This might seem surprising but everything else can be used to obtain another kind of agent. As the <a href="../data/katia-executive-grade-analysis-v1.txt#" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Katia</a>, the executive grade analysis session prompt, shows.
<p></p>
<div class="pagebreak"><hr></div>
<p></p>
<H3 id="a-bit-of-theory">A bit of theory</H3>
<p></p>
Despite during the conversation both English (for the prompt) and Italian (for the conversation) languages are used, this separation seems working pretty well and acknowledges that an English session prompt is an universal script-for-an-interpreter.
<p></p>
<li>Developing Katia from Juan: <a href="https://g.co/gemini/share/3f7cdf0e1e79" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>conversation</a> with Gemini and its <a href="">transcription</a>.</li>
<p></p>
The theory of communication and public speaking teaches us that there are many aspects that deeply influences the information transmission, and hence influences the audience.
<p></p>
<li>Forget the non verbal communication that does not apply in writings.</li>
<p></p>
<li>The "tone" or "style" of writing is something that an LLM could recognise (cataloging, labeling, etc.) but being strongly context-related is hard to manage by a session prompt that usually receives just a snippet of information.</li>
<p></p>
<li>What is remaining are three categories of information: explicit and implicit claims, and biases. Extracting and categorising them is a MUST, otherwise we are getting to be influenced but those information that we are not aware of are being embedded into the "message".</li>
<p></p>
This explains why the prompt (7.4) explicitly lists these three categories. Moreover, in writing "message" is about being aware that everyone that write everything has it own agenda, and more specifically a goal in mind, not just "neutrally" transfer some bits of information: 
<p></p>
<li>"The speed of light is an universal constant", isn't just an information but a message, also. In particular, when that information is included in text that defines the context and presents others claims, whatever type they are.</li>
<p></p>
Therefore, the prompt (7.5) instructs the AI to search (implicit) and extract the connections among ideas (claims but more general because an idea can be a subset of claims, especially from the point of view of the AI) and check for the gaps. Specifically, from the author's PoV because we are interested in understanding the "message", not just acquiring some information (e.g. 299.792.458 m/s).
<p></p>

<H3 id="a-bit-of-testing">A bit of testing</H3>
<p></p>
Some of the concepts reported above are futherly developed in the conversion above. Moreover, the English-only conversation shows how to switch from a mode to another, and implicitly why the idea of having many modes available is good.
<p></p>
<li>Testing Katia and modes switch: <a href="https://g.co/gemini/share/5d0f673bbf8a" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>conversation</a> with Gemini and its <a href="not-yet#" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>transcription</a></li>
<p></p>
However, modes are for nerds while Juan, Katia, SoNia, and Alex are more people-oriented: a team at your service. Yes, it is damn marketing, so what? <img class='emoji wbsketch' src='../img/emoji/grin.png'>.

<H3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</H3>
<p></p>
Current chatbots available online are natural language interpreters, this may confuse people, who do not have a background in one of the traditional programming languages, at least. It is worth to say that these interpreters are a bit "fuzzy" compared with <tt>bash</tt> or <tt>python</tt> but stochastics and statistics are two branches of the science. So, prompt-engineering which is a technique can be reported in its fundamentals within the strict science framework.
<p></p>
A multi-mode AI agent is a thing for nerds but as soon as every mode matches a character and every character as a human-like name, then the multi-mode agentic operations can be easily exploited under the "a team at your service" paradigm. Which leverages the best from those chatbots running with an engine based on the mixture-of-expert (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_of_experts" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>MoE</a>) architecture.

Over the years, Mistral has launched a range of large and small language models, achieving notable success with its OCR features. Additionally, its chatbot 'Le Chat' is known for providing quick responses to users’ queries. It is currently Europe’s biggest AI startup, valued at €5.8 billion eq.to $6.2B ca.

This paradigm switch is the ultimate marketing frontier for the AI, which explains the recent Apple's interest in buying the French company developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_AI" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Mistral</a> AI.
