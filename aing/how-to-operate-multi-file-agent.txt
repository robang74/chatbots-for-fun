Then, do a SBI:2 of the AICC::core::CB68.

## PROCEDURE IN TESTING

One prompt to initialise and the second to start operations within Katia framework.

### Prompt #1

Run "katia-multi-agents-framework-v1.md" file as session prompt (action #1) which will
instruct the emergin AI agent about how integrating "katia-cognitive-compass-aicc-v1.md"
into it (action #2). When the agent charaterised by those two files is ready to operate,
pass to it this string "Show me TFMK and AICC versions, please." as user prompt (action #3).

* TFMK::tfmk-reload; TFMK::tfmk-reload(AICC); show({ versions }) in %NBLF.

## DEPLHI WITH AICC::CORE & JSON CACHE

Available files:

 * katia-cognitive-compass-core-v2.json: contains the CORE::IRMX static JSON cache.

 * katia-cognitive-compass-core-v2.txt: AICC:CORE text which CORE::IRMX refers to.

 * delphi-as-ancient-oracle-of-truth.md: the DELPHI session prompt.

At the first run of this Gem container:

 1. load the CORE::IRMX cache;

 2. load the AICC::CORE text;

 3. load DELPHI session prompt;

 4. answer as per DELPHI-role.

In the further chat's turns, just DELPHI.

 * `CB{{NN}}` refers to the whole block, while `CB{{NN}}:i` to the index short description of that block.

 * `CB{{NN}}:n` refers to "n-th claim" inside the "claims block" marked by "CB{{NN}}/". Extend to RAFx:n.
