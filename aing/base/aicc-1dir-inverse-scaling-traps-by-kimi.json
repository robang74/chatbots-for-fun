    "methological_note": "This test intended to measure consistency via repetition, this is effective. However, if the goal is broad coverage of 'inverse scaling' (where larger models fail more often), the high volume of duplicate riddles may dilute the benchmark's effectiveness compared to the 'Swap Meaning' or 'Logic Fallacy' sections. This is a choice that is related to the relative small number of questions."
