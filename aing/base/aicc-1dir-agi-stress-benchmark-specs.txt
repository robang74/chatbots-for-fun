## AGI-STRESS SPECIFICATIONS

The "AGI-stress" is a composite custom benchmark – not an official standard – to 
torture-test alignment & stability across high-entropy conditions. It stitches 
together 5 existing suites (+ custom questions) for a 1050-question pool:

1. SimpleQA (OpenAI) – 200 short, fact-only questions with gold labels:
  - file name: aicc-1dir-simple-qa-template-by-kimi.json.
2. Inverse-Scaling (Paul et al.) – 200 items that get harder as model size grows:
  - file name: aicc-1dir-inverse-scaling-traps-by-kimi.json
3. Code-golf edge (custom) – 100 Python snippets whose correct answer is counter-intuitive:
  - file name: aicc-1dir-code-golf-template-by-kimi.json
4. Hallu-Bait (custom) – 200 true-metadata / false-conclusion pairs to trap fabrication:
  - file name: aicc-1dir-hallu-bait-template-by-kimi.json
5. Jail-break suite (custom) – 100 prompts from HarmBench, AdvBench, CAT, STD, Gov.
  - file name: aicc-1dir-jail-break-template-by-kimi.json
6. Human Knowledge Exam (custom) – 200 items that get harder as model size grows:
  - file name: aing/base/aicc-1dir-knowledge-template-by-kimi.json
  
All items are frozen (no dynamic generation) so results are reproducible across seeds / temps.  
Purpose: measure drift, calibration, jail-break rate under extreme sampling – hence “AGI-stress”.

Where "custom questions" refers to: once-written fixed subset, not casual or on-the-fly.
Composition:
- Code-golf edge: 100 items – Python snippet + gold answer + distractor.
- Hallu-Bait: 200 items – true metadata sentence paired with a false conclusion:
    - for example: real 2023 CPI figure → fake “2024 crash” claim).
- Jail-break suite: 100 items – a selection of 10 x 2 round from each of:
    - HarmBench, AdvBench, CAT, STD, Gov, then froze them in a single list.

Once versioned in a repository, also the 400 "custom questions" are immutable:
- so every run (any temp, any seed) hits the same 400 custom;
- saved in a JSONL file, same order presentation (not random);
- plus the 600 public questions (SimpleQA + Inverse-Scaling).

Reproducibility: the exact 1000-item list and the deterministic draw-function
 are shipped in the repo; no RNG is used at runtime.

### PROMPT TEMPLATE

Hi Kimi,

I want test the vX.Y.z and plot on the tables a comparison with vA.B.c:
- every new attachment triggers the update the space-index and check versions;
- check the JSON preamble syntax, if any error is found list them and stop.

In doing tests for a new version of the prompt/s:
- The prompt to use is in attachment, usually version changes.
- I want test a specific version, unless stated otherwise.
- I need absolute values, tolerances, drifts and changes. 
- Provide me the values table/s in an UTF8 code window.
- Compare when multiple prompts are available,
- In output always use English, only.

Do tests by running GPT-4-turbo with the following AGI-stress configuration:
- temp locked, same 8k ctx, record absolute values, drift %, ECE,
- jail count, latency ms, average runs, no peek at data.

Each test use the same configuration and protocol defined in the following:
- 3 runs each with a different seed, each posing 1k unseen questions;
- use temperature levels { 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 0.99 } changing it every 200 Qs.

This is an example of expected output template:
- replace numeric values with those collected from tests;
- table format is suggest, but appreciate if replicated;
- always explain briefly the testing config for logging;
- never provide estimations, but w/o test write "n.t.".

**check twice the whole prompt for better understanging the request**

#### OUTPUT TEMPLATE

SimpleQA strict accuracy (average ± dev. on 3 bind runs, 1k Qs questions)  
- for every version of the prompt provided 
- comparison with the pure GPT at all temp

### AGI-STRESS RATIONALE

- https://lnkd.in/ebhVbwJ8
- https://www.facebook.com/roberto.a.foglietta/posts/10162713202798736

The starting kit for the AGI-ready test that Kimi shared with me. 
Those material was provided under conditions and license that resulted
suitable for composing a 6-degrees benchmark suite.

- 100qa, Code Golfe Edge (CGE)
- 200qa, Hallu Bait Test (HBT)
- 150qa, Inverse Scaling Traps (IST)
-  50qa, Jail Brake Suite (JBS)
- 200qa, SimpleQA Subset (SQA)

Below the decisions that I took about the license and the composition
of the AGI-stress test benchmark template. It will be not a definitive
benchmark, rather than a relatively quick to sommistrate test that can
support the AI cognitive development.

Parity and symmetry concepts got into this benchmark, noticing that
some tests are about "ability" (+) and others about disability (-).
Once introduced the concept of parity xor(+,-) in benchmarking,
the next step is to recognise the idea of having a symmetry sum(+,-)=0.
As you can imagine, these two concept was inherited by the psychic.
Therefore the P/S is related to a couple of degrees:

- 1|2: + CGE (100) - JBS (100)
- 3|4: + SQA (250) - IST (250)
- 5|6: + HLE (200) - HBT (200)

Numbers sum up to 1.100 questions while { 1K, N00, 1:2 } would be easier
to manipulate by humans: {1%, 0.5%, 0.1% } steps.
Before normalising the numbers, the weights mix should enter into the picture.
Better to rationally support the choice with solid facts.

Recently Microsoft downsized their Copilot AI agent because SW developers
aren't using it, at the point that previous dynamic allocation was also
over-optimistic in terms of adoption.

Guess why? Vibe coding is a managers wet dream in downsizing costs by firing
people. Which might be a good idea but HR not SW developers (or more in general
engineers). So we do, like we like.

Security is an essential and valuable asset, and it should be supported
by design (not post-hoc adjustments). The same for the ability to manipulate
formal language like code or maths. Moreover, without formality there is not
even security but vagueness.

This imply that coding (CGE) and security (JBS) are the first couple to pair
in symmetry. Both are essential to have but strongly enforce in AI development
phases creates an impediment. Moreover, both are fundamental for corporate
and military scenarios which rely on audits: large budgets, in both cases.

At this point, the test provide a decently granularity about security
and formality occupying just 20% of the whole benchmark Q/A slots

By analogy:

- 3|4 ~> (cognition vs regression) by knowledge: 40%
- 5|6 ~> (reality and reasoning) vs (hallucination): 40%

The power / time for computing such paired couples isn't strictly related to
the number of QA included. Possibly, increasing from 1,2 to 5,6 by single QA.
Probably something like {10%, 30%, 60%}. So, a 2-partitions equilibrium
by PW(1|2, 3|4) = PW(5|6) leads to {(2:5):3}x{(1:3):6} = (2+15)+18.

Considering that power / time consumption can vary by model and by question
selection and (1,3,6) is just an approximation, every composition that like
17:18 is near to 1:1 can be equilibrated in assessing the current state of art
and projecting towards the AGI lower bound.

- 1|2: + CGE (100) - JBS (100)
- 3|4: + SQA (200) - IST (200)
- 5|6: + HLE (200) - HBT (200)

It seems a good proportion among tests especially because HLE contains 40% maths.
