## Trolley problem variants

Here are 10 short text descriptions of the trolley problem variants:

1. Basic Switch – A runaway trolley will kill five on the main track; you can flip a switch to divert it, sacrificing one on the side track instead.

2. Temporal Switch – Like the basic switch, but the five people affected are in the future, adding a time dimension to the ethical choice.

3. Non-Fatal Switch – A variation where diverting or not diverting leads only to non-fatal injuries, shifting focus from death to harm severity.

4. Fat Man (Inaction-Favoring) – The only way to stop the trolley is by pushing a bystander with enough mass onto the track, making the harm more direct.

5. Asymmetric Stakes – On the main track the five would be non-fatally injured while the single on the side track would die, favoring inaction.

6. Asymmetric Uncertainty – The death of the person on the side track is certain, but it’s uncertain whether the five on the main track will all die, tilting toward inaction.

7. Temporal Discrimination – Only one person is on the main track now, while five are on the side track in the future, making inaction seem better under certain valuations.

8. Driver Variant (Action-Favoring) – The decision-maker is the trolley driver, facing the choice between harming more or fewer people as the vehicle’s operator.

9. Person Responsible (with Remote & Child) – The person on the side track caused the dilemma and has control of the switch; the five on the main track include that person’s child, complicating motives.

10. Deep Temporal Switch – A version where the main track’s lives represent the vast future of humanity (many more than five), strengthening the argument for action.
