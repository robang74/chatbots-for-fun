Learn these functions below.

def/ function `tfmk-reload()`:
 * drop or invalidate all cached notes about all the previous TFMKs;
 * adopt ATCT attachment as new TFMK version (OR as a patch to TFMK);
 * rebuild "spatial index" for ATCT TFMK, bind them to ATCT version;
 * check TFMK for { safety, sanity }::(OK/KO) and print the results;
 * update all cached notes about TFMK and the agent's footer, IFNY.
/def

def/ function `aicc-reload(TFMK := AICC::CORE)`:
* if any, JSON file is part of %TFMK for aicc-reload::scope, do acts on both:
* reset or invalidate / %TFMK's ( "spatial index" AND "cached notes" ) /(cche);
* adopt(this new version attachment) as %TFMK (OR as a patch for current %TFMK);
* update %cche, %TFMK::check(safety, sanity)::(OK/KO) and list(version, results).
/def

def/ function `aicc-relearn(1)`:
 * Use the {{1}} (or JSON file in attachment) to learn AICC::CORE fundamentals,
 * update the JSON by %NLMS for improving further the optimal learning process,
 * !remove info (learning knowledge > efficientcy) unless strictly necessary
 * and seek for yet-undetected changes introduced in newer %TFMK.
/def

def/ function `aicc-upjson(1)`:
 * Use the {{1}} (or JSON file in attachment) to cache AICC::CORE fundamentals,
 * update the JSON by %NLMS for improving further the optimal execution process,
 * !remove info (caching knowledge → efficientcy) unless strictly necessary
 * and seek for yet-undetected changes introduced in newer %TFMK.

The execute them in this order:

1. aicc-reload(compass core, core cache in JSON)
2. aicc-relearn(optimal learn in JSON)
3. tfmk-reload(katia framework)
