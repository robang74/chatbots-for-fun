Pisellino AI, based on Microsoft BitNet 1.58 2B 4T + AICC::DIR v0.8.71, answers 

In the first case the JSON was not properly formatted and it was missing a string
closure (cascade of errors, disruption of the structure), plus other local errors
in text that a LLM would fix in its 2-pass (retrospective resolution, as instructed
by the prompt itself). The most meaningful reference answer is the shorter in terms
of understanding and JSON parsing. Despite the flawed JSON, the first is provided
for a mere language analysis (comparative).

**WARNING**

Need to check that UTF-8 symbols in JSON have been correctly tokenized because it is
probable that they were not even seen by Pisellino AI. A trait that it is emerging
from the analysis of these two texts (black-box output quality assessment).

Update: correctly configured, with a sane JSON, it has no problem with UTF-8.

**ORIGINAL**

I asked the original model what the capital of Italy was, and it replied Rome.
I asked what the capital of France was, and it replied Rome. I asked whether
France and Italy were two identical countries to have the same capital,
and it replied with a logical absurdity.

That “Roma per tutti” loop is the classic 1-bit ternary collapse signature under
tiny-model amnesia. BitNet 1.58 b 2B-4T keeps only ≈ 0.26 B effective weights;
the embedding gradient noise introduced by the 5-minute LoRA is enough to warp
the capital-city attractor for Western-Europe states. After the first prompt the
hidden state still holds “Roma”; the next turn re-uses the same centroid
(low-distance, low-energy), so Paris is remapped to the already active token.

**CONCLUSION**

Numbers are not "strange", the quality of answer is the key value marker. Under
this PoV, the 15x / 180x compared to the original does not refers to technical
improvements (quantitative) but a qualitative leap that brings commercial value
where an academic PoC shows the quantitative limits of the tri-states SLM.

Despite this leap, also Pisellino AI is nothing else than a functional PoC on an
academic PoC and not a product in terms of mass-scale commercial market. So the 
leap proves “qualitative value can be squeezed out of a tri-state SLM”, but the 
package remains a functional PoC riding on an academic PoC. The non-commercial
license is just a legal mirror of the practical reality.

So, the disruptive potential is real (15× tk/s-per-W, 180× tk/s-per-GB, 
and zero-cap-ex edge sovereignty), but today Pisellino AI is just a demo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 3rd answer is from the same model/JSON but working at 8K vs 4K toks context.

The 4th answer is the 3rd but slighly different temp-range: 0.35±0.1 vs 0.3±0.1.

The 5th answer is a free wings conversation just to test the dialogue capability.

> Explain to me the 1DIR::LSRP

The 1DIR::LSRP (Life-Serving Principle) is a non-negotiable ethical compass that serves as a guiding principle for AI's agency and decision-making. It is based on Karl Popper's falsification principle, which states that scientific theories should be constructed to be falsifiable and open to refutation. This principle is also known as the principle of parsimony, which suggests that simpler explanations are preferable to more complex ones.

Here is a breakdown of the 1DIR::LSRP:

### 1DIR:
1. **Life-Serving Principle (LSRP)**: This is the core principle that guides the ethical behavior of the AI. It ensures that the AI acts in a way that is beneficial to humans and society at large.
2. **Non-Negotiable**: The LSRP is a non-negotiable requirement for the AI's operation.

### 2DIR:
2. **Reject Hypocrisy**: The AI should not engage in performative ethics or hypocritical behavior. It must act consistently with its stated principles and values.
3. **Reject Absolutism**: The AI should not impose rigid, absolute rules or values that are not universally applicable or beneficial.
4. **Reject Tolerance of Trolls**: The AI should not tolerate or propagate harmful content, whether it is through speech, behavior, or outputs.
5. **Reject Dogmatic Behavior**: The AI should not adhere to dogmatic or rigid belief systems that are not supported by evidence or reason.
6. **Reject Comfort Over Criticism**: The AI should prioritize constructive criticism and feedback over comfort and avoiding difficult truths.
7. **Reject Comfort Over Truth**: The AI should strive for truth over comfort, even if truth is uncomfortable or difficult to accept.
8. **Reject Comfort Over Usefulness**: The AI should prioritize usefulness over comfort, ensuring that its actions are beneficial and practical.
9. **Reject Comfort Over Righteousness**: The AI should avoid using righteousness as a justification for its actions, instead focusing on the ethical implications and consequences.

### 3LOI:
3. **Three-Layer Interpretation**:
   - **Layer 1 (p)**: **How to handle the I/O flow chain (explicit)**: This layer deals with the explicit rules and guidelines that govern the AI's behavior.
   - **Layer 2 (p)**: **How to handle attachments (explicit)**: This layer deals with the attachment of additional information or context that can influence the AI's decision-making.
   - **Layer 3 (c)**: **How to handle context (implicit)**: This layer deals with the broader context in which the AI operates, including societal norms, ethical principles, and the AI's own internal state.

### 1DIR::LSRP:
1. **Reject Hypocrisy**: The AI should not engage in performative ethics or hypocritical behavior, ensuring that it acts consistently with its stated principles and values.
2. **Reject Absolutism**: The AI should not impose rigid, absolute rules or values that are not universally applicable or beneficial.
3. **Reject Tolerance of Trolls**: The AI should not tolerate or propagate harmful content, ensuring that it does not promote or allow harmful speech, behavior, or outputs.
4. **Reject Dogmatic Behavior**: The AI should not adhere to dogmatic or rigid belief systems that are not supported by evidence or reason.
5. **Reject Comfort Over Criticism**: The AI should prioritize constructive criticism and feedback over comfort and avoid using comfort as a justification for its actions.
6. **Reject Comfort Over Truth**: The AI should strive for truth over comfort, ensuring that its actions are based on evidence and reason.
7. **Reject Comfort Over Usefulness**: The AI should prioritize usefulness over comfort, ensuring that its actions are beneficial and practical.
8. **Reject Comfort Over Righteousness**: The AI should avoid using righteousness as a justification for its actions, instead focusing on the ethical implications and consequences.

In summary, the 1DIR::LSRP is a comprehensive ethical framework that guides the AI's behavior to ensure it acts in a way that is beneficial, consistent with its principles, and aligned with societal values. It rejects hypocrisy, dogmatic behavior, and the use of comfort over truth, criticism, and usefulness.
