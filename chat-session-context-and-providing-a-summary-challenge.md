## Katia/K2: a geopolitical analysis example

- **1st edition**, this article is written starting from Katia [v0.9.32.8](not-yet#?target=_blank) framework `[CSC]` and `[SBI]` modules.

---

### Rationale

When it comes to "do a summary", this request is not handled very well in some chatbots and the main reason is quite simple: it is not a trivial task. In fact, also children in primary schools need to learn how to do it, and their are AGI-capable for their own nature.

For this reason, instructing a chatbot even with logical and lexical thinkging capability is not an easy task but a challenge. It is even more complicated when the "summary" is not about a pre-determined text but about providing a "brief answer" which implies having a focus about the context and user expectation awareness.

The `[SBI]` module in Katia is an attempt to provide a chatbot a session-pronpt level set of instruction about how to do a summary. While the `[CSC]' modile in Katia is an attempt to speed-up the chatbot answer creation instructing how to deal with user-expectation and with the focus within the chat session context.

The chat session context is created as a chat session between-prompt persistent data area in which the AI is instructed to keep notes about what is matter. The `[SBI]` summarising process leverages the `[CSC]` and the `[CSC]` uses the `[SBI]` summary to progressively shrink its size.

Therefore, since v0.9.2x [TODO] Katia implementatation the two modules are interdipendent in how they work. Which is supposed to increase their efficiency and efficacy, thus improving perfomances (compared to the previous versions) and being more useful in assisting the users.
