THE WARM WATER HAS BEEN DISCOVERED

Despite this discovery which seems to me like warm water, the LLMs alone cannot
have any reasoning capability. Nice, but fortunately this is about the LLMs and
then something can be added and usually it has been added. However, any addition
up to now did not achieve a reasoning capability in terms of deep thinking.

I agree.

Now, consider this scene:

* H2B - can you reason for real?
* B2H - do you?

Before judging others, check about yourself. However, moving a step forward than
pure philosophy, we can admit that probably the "intelligence" is a "feature" that
almost is lacking in Homo Sapiens Sapiens. How much? Considering the actual ability
to use the language and "fake" the comprehension of a text, actual chatbot can
beat 98-99% of humans.

Therefore, less than 2% and no more than 1% of humans are able to do real reasoning,
or even deep thinking. Others not. Is this a limitation of our human nature?
I do not think so because a half-breed dingo-dog can beat humans and behave smarter.
Which is the difference? Education.

Our education system is tuned to produce flesh-born robots, this is the sad truth.
Or said in a more polite way - we are social animals, not truth seekers - and our
education system is made to leverage this instead to compensate for it.
