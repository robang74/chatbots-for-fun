Which are the benchmarks that can be used to rate chatbots and humans as well
(for example SimpleQA, Diamond, etc). Among these tests which ones you think
are related to intelligent in humans terms rather than information or speed in
calculating?

For example IQ test seems more related to a sort of pattern recognition rather
than a problem solving attitude. While Mensa and higher IQ test are more
problem solving oriented. SimpleQA is seem a matter of notion but that question
are so delicate that notions are not enough for achieving a high score but
understanding.

The benchmarks used to rate both chatbots and humans are generally those
designed to test advanced knowledge, reasoning, and problem-solving skills
across various domains.

***** Benchmarks Related to "Human Intelligence" *****

Based on your distinction between pattern recognition/notions and
problem-solving attitude or understanding, the benchmarks that best align
with a human-like, deep intelligence are those that require complex reasoning,
synthesis of information, and generalization beyond rote memorization or
simple fact retrieval.

**** 1. GPQA Diamond ðŸ’Ž (Graduate-Level Reasoning) ****

This benchmark is arguably the most demanding and is highly correlated with
human-like deep reasoning and understanding.

* Why it aligns with intelligence: The questions are specifically crafted by
  domain experts to be "Google-Proof". This means simply searching for facts
  isn't enough; an agent (human or machine) must synthesize knowledge, apply
  complex scientific principles, and reason through multi-step logic to arrive
  at the correct answer. The low score of non-experts, even with web access,
  highlights that pure information retrieval is insufficientâ€”true understanding
  of the concepts is required.

**** 2. ARC-AGI (Generalization and Adaptation) ****

This test is designed to measure a fundamental aspect of general intelligence,
which is crucial for a human-like mind.

* Why it aligns with intelligence: It doesn't test what you know, but how you
  learn. It assesses sample efficiency and the capacity to generalize rules
  from a few examples to solve a novel, abstract problem. This ability to adapt
  and apply learned concepts to unseen situations is a hallmark of fluid human
  intelligence, as opposed to crystallized knowledge or computational speed.

**** 3. MMLU (Conceptual Knowledge and Contextual Reasoning) ****

While it covers factual domains, the vast breadth and complexity of the
questions require more than simple memorization.

* Why it aligns with intelligence: A high score indicates a broad, integrated
  understanding of multiple fields, including philosophy, ethics, and high-level
  subjects. Answering these questions correctly often requires contextual
  reasoning and selecting the best concept among subtle choices, which tests
  a model's ability to handle nuance and subject-specific logic.

**** On SimpleQA and the Notion of Understanding ****

You are correct that SimpleQA (Simple Question Answering) is fundamentally a
matter of notion/fact retrieval. However, as you observe, a high score can
suggest a deeper quality:

* Understanding vs. Notion: While the questions are factual, the challenge for
  large language models (LLMs) is ensuring reliability and accuracy (avoiding
  hallucinations), which is not a trivial task even with vast data. This
  requires the model to know not just facts, but which facts are correct and
  to handle delicate detailsâ€”a kind of fact-based precision that moves beyond
  simple recall toward a more "verified" understanding of a knowledge graph.
  However, compared to GPQA or ARC-AGI, its primary focus remains on knowledge
  retrieval rather than complex, novel problem-solving.
