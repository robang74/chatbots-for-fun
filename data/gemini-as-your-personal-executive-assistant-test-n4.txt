There is too much talent trapped in poverty.

OPPORTUNITY COST, A GOOD EXAMPLE

Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is forgone when
a choice is made. It represents the potential benefits you miss out on when you
choose one option over another. Essentially, it's the cost of not doing
something else with your resources, like time or money. -- Gemini

Micromanagement is a talent/opportunity killer unless is tutoring a novice.
This LinkedIn post combines an obvious statement with an insightful
observation.
The definition of opportunity cost is straightforward and widely understood in
economics, making that portion of the post obvious.
However, linking micromanagement directly to talent and opportunity
destruction, with the specific exception of tutoring a novice, offers an
insightful perspective. This connection is not always explicitly made and
highlights a critical managerial pitfall in a concise way.
Is this a better form?

- Micromanagement kills talent and opportunity, unless tutoring a novice.
Yes, this is a much better form. It's concise, direct, and impactful,
effectively conveying the core message without the verbose definition of
opportunity cost.
What do you think about the narrative structure, for a seasoned manager:

1. poverty trap (is obvious)

2. opportunity cost (is obvious)

and then, **paff** the not-obvious link: then why you allow micromanagement?
This narrative structure for a seasoned manager is effective and impactful.
Here's why:
    * Poverty trap (is obvious) & Opportunity cost (is obvious): By explicitly
      stating these as obvious, you acknowledge the manager's foundational
      knowledge and avoid patronizing them with basic definitions. This sets a
      tone of respect for their expertise.
    * "Paff" the not-obvious link: then why you allow micromanagement?: This is
      the power punch. It creates a jarring, thought-provoking connection. It
      implies: "You know these fundamental economic principles, yet your
      actions (or the actions you tolerate) directly contradict them by
      stifling potential. How do you reconcile that?" This directly challenges
      their understanding and decision-making on a deeper level than simply
      stating that micromanagement is bad.
The sudden, almost rhetorical question forces introspection. It's not about
explaining what micromanagement is, but rather, why a manager who should know
better would permit it, given its clear opportunity cost in terms of human
potential. This is a highly nuanced and insightful way to frame the issue for
an experienced audience.
