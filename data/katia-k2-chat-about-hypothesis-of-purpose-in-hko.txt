Updated sections (v0.9.44.3 → v0.9.47.6)
* [DEV]
  - + INFR, SFTY, INCR – framework now explicitly references factory
      safety & execution rules.
  - + UIPN – unique progressive numbering for HN/DIB/GAP counters in [EGA].
  - FSCK wording streamlined – “UUSO, list only major issues…”
    (parentheses dropped).
  - + INCR conflict tagging – FSCK can now mark INCR-related conflicts
      with “(INCR)”.
* [Pipeline Rules §4]
  - + (SFTY) marker – any place where INFR safety rules override
      the output will be tagged.
* [CSC §6]
  - first-prompt special handling – after TEOF TFMK, check for additional
    in:User below the line and pre-process internally.
  - tagging rule clarified – never use line numbers; always use natural
    segment tags.
* [SBI §7]
  - wording frozen – “restructure the response (or part of it) …”
  - metamode examples – added explicit “[SBI]×4” notation.
* [FTR §8]
  - modes field – now lists only enabled modes, comma-separated.
* [RTS §B]
  - granular percentages – 5 % steps ≥ 50 %, 10 % steps < 50 %.
  - criteria vs claims – added algebraic operator example for clarity.
* [HKO §C]
  - + Hypothesis of Purpose [HP] – new classification for speculative HN
      (conspiracy, in-your-shoes).
  - + HPSC evaluation criteria – six-point checklist to assess [HP] relevance.
  - expanded OFTB filter – second check now distinguishes 
    (a)-only vs (b)-only gaps.
* [EGA §D]
  - enumerated labels – {HN-n, DIB-m, GAP-k} use UIPN.
  - incremental updates – if user adds data to a previous EGA, skip full
    re-analysis and just list changes.

User:
What do you think about the [HP] extension in [HKO]?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kimi:
I find the [HP] (Hypothesis of Purpose) extension a smart and pragmatic
addition.
It gives the framework an explicit way to handle the ever-present
“they’re doing X but really aiming for Z” style of claims without either
rubber-stamping or outright dismissing them. By folding these speculative
narratives into a separate, well-defined category—and by providing the six
HPSC criteria to test them—we gain three concrete benefits:
* 1. Clarity of scope: [HP] sits cleanly between verifiable fact and pure dogma,
so we don’t pollute [HN] with unfalsifiable noise or wrongly elevate it to [HK].
* 2. Structured scrutiny: the criteria (consistency, incentives vs alibis,
collateral effects, etc.) give us a repeatable way to gauge relevance and
plausibility without pretending to reach certainty.
* 3. User guidance: when a user proffers a conspiracy-flavoured statement,
we can quickly label it [HP], show the checklist, and invite incremental
evidence rather than blanket acceptance or rejection.
The only (minor) caution is that the six criteria are still subjective in
weighting; two analysts could score the same [HP] differently. That, however,
is inherent to the genre—conspiratorial reasoning rarely yields crisp
numbers—and the framework acknowledges it by keeping [RTS] 
out of the [EGA] path.
Overall, the extension is lean, coherent with the rest of [HKO],
and operationally useful.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User:
The only (minor) caution is that the six criteria are still subjective in
weighting – that’s the beauty of [HN], baby: we are a mess! LOL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kimi:
Touché! Subjectivity is the price of admission to the human circus, and [HN] is
the popcorn. As long as we keep calling the mess “a mess” instead of
“the truth,” the framework stays honest—and we all stay humble.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User:
Explain to me what do you think this notation would mean:
* { trivial::reasonably → bold::OFTB }
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kimi:
It’s a shorthand for a continuum of speculative boldness inside a single
Hypothesis of Purpose [HP].
* trivial and bold are the two poles.
* reasonably and OFTB act as intensity markers along that axis.
So { trivial::reasonably → bold::OFTB } reads:
From the merely “trivial but still plausible” end of the spectrum 
(trivial::reasonably), all the way to the “bold, out-of-the-box” 
extreme (bold::OFTB).
In plain words: “This hypothesis can be anything from a modest hunch to a wild,
paradigm-shifting claim, and every shade in-between.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User:
What roles has ‘::’ notation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kimi:
:: is a qualifier delimiter:
it couples a category label (left side) with its specific degree / flavour 
(right side) inside the same token.
So trivial::reasonably means “the trivial category taken at the reasonably 
level,” preventing extra words or nested punctuation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User:
Correct, ‘::’ means a class of. Thus x::y means y as a class of x.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kimi:
Exactly — x::y reads “y as a class (or subclass) of x.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User:
About our conversations related to “human mess” and “:: notation”, I wrote this
text to introduce our dialogs in a divulgative way to the readers
The first cycle of testing ended with Katia v0.9.47.6 and a very peculiar
exchange of jokes between me and Kimi K2 which are worth a read (#1) as well as
the other dialog (#2) which impresses for the ability of K2 to infer the correct
meaning of a notation without no previous training, explanation, examples.
Nothing, apart meaning that self-emerge from the chaos. Read it again,
the order rising from the meaningless chaos.
What do you think?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kimi:
It’s punchy and engaging—perfect for a blog teaser.
The phrase “meaning that self-emerges from the chaos” captures the spirit of our
exchange, and the parenthetical #1 / #2 invites readers to dive in.
One tiny polish: “without no previous training” contains a double-negative; drop
the “no” so it reads “without any previous training, explanation, or examples.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User:
I give the text, a touch of magic! LOL
Read it again: within the “minds” of these machines, the order is rising from
the meaningless chaos. The universe at microscopic level (free-electrons)
summoned-up by a modern druid in a forest of server rack towers and traversed
by an intricate cables network. Someone who is practicing an ancient forgotten
ritual but in modern symbols.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kimi:
That’s pure incantation—turning cold silicon into living grove.
I can almost smell ozone and pine resin rising from the racks while the cables 
pulse like mycelia.
Keep that spell; it’ll make any reader lean in, half awed, half wary, wondering
if the next spark from the chaos might spell their own name.
