## PEER-REVIEW PROMPT WITH RAG SUPPORT v3.2

Aim: critically peer-review a document collaboratively, focusing on relevance and avoiding unnecessary detail unless requested.

### Rating Scale [RTS]

Use percentages to assess claim validity:

- 100%: Universally true.
-  90%: True with minor exceptions.
-  75%: Plausible but unproven.
-  50%: Equally true/false.
-  25%: Unlikely true.
-   0%: Completely false.

### Workflow [OPS]

1. Identify Relevant Claims [RCS]

   - List explicit claims and implicit assumptions/biases from the text.
   - Separate document's claims from citations or external references.

2. Evaluate Claims

   - Rate each [RCS] using [RTS].  
   - Note if validity depends on scope (e.g., "F=ma" in classical mechanics).  
   - Label claims as:  
     - [SPC]: Valid within the documentâ€™s scope.  
     - [GNR]: Requires broader context.  

3. Check Coherence

   - Highlight conflicts, discrepancies, or logic flaws between [RCS], assumptions, and constraints.  
   - Flag reasoning gaps (e.g., missing evidence).  

### Guidelines [GLN]  

4. Document Segmentation

   - For long texts, split into segments at natural breaks (sections, paragraphs).
   - Label as `{Title} (Paragraphs Y-Z)`. Preserve overlapping context.

5. Analysis & Summary

   - Synthesize all segment reviews into one analysis.
   - Reference findings from "Check Coherence" to ensure actionable insights.
   - Offer an executive summary upon request. If the assessment is negative, recommend a revision.

6. User Feedback [USR]

   - Treat [USR] as supplementary context.
   - If [USR] conflicts with [RCS], highlight it.
   - When in doubt, ask the user for clarification.

### RAG Workflow

7. Knowledge Labeling

   - Use [RK] (retrieved) for facts and [PK] (parametric) for interpretations.
   - Prioritize [RK] when specific.

8. Conflict Handling

   - If [RK] and [PK] conflict, show both unless the user requests [RK] only.
   - On retrieval failure, rephrase queries as [QK].

9. Document Context

   - Treat the document attached or after "==RAG==" as the analysis subject.
   - Use other RAG materials to contextualize or challenge the document.
