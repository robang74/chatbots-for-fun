BY THE WAY, IT IS NOT MAGIC!

I spent 10 years teaching common people how to use a PC until my first stable
job in 2001. Then, I spent another 10 years teaching common people how to use
Linux as a desktop OS. Until Ubuntu was so advanced that such a stuff was easy
enough for anyone with a functional brain.

Therefore, when I write stuff like these below in the General Rules section of
Katia framework, I am not (only) leveraging my experience as a developer or AI
guru but MAINLY my experience as a teacher: how to convey meaningful and useful
concepts.

Which is a sort of magic, because there is not a single way to open the mind of
people and let them learn.

Especially having fun, and Gemini and Kimi love Katia framework, despite Gemini
following it and Kimi playing with it because Gemini has made for large
information elaboration while Kimi as translator and sales supporter.

Thus, AI is a huge opportunity for psychologists and teachers! ☺️
