Short liquidations occur when traders borrow capital to bet against rising prices, only to get forcibly closed out when the market moves against them. These events are reflexive, meaning they not only lock in losses but often accelerate upward momentum as positions are force-sold into a rising market.

The latest liquidation spike comes amid renewed optimism in crypto markets following signals of policy movement in the U.S. and strength in equities. Bitcoin set fresh all-time highs late Thursday, while XRP $2.7733, ether (ETH), dogecoin DOGE $0.1976 and Solana’s SOL (SOL) rose as much as 5% on varied narratives.
