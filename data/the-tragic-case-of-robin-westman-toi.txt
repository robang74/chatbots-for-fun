TIMESOFINDIA.COM | Aug 28, 2025, 11.01 AM IST
A gunman opened fire at a Catholic church school in Minneapolis on Wednesday morning, killing two children
and injuring at least 17 others.
The attacker fired with a rifle through the church window, where nearly 200 students had gathered for prayers in
their first week of school. Authorities later confirmed that the gunman died from self-inflicted injuries.
"The FBI is investigating this shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics," FBI
Director Kash Patel said in a post on X.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the attack as “unthinkable,” saying in a post on X that the
administration’s “deepest prayers” were with the children, families, educators, and the wider Christian
community. “We mourn with them, pray for their healing, and will never forget this tragedy,” she added.
Here are the 10 things to know about the Minneapolis school shooting.
How the attack unfolded?
The attacker dressed in all black carried a rifle, shotgun and pistol, walked up to the side of Annunciation Catholic
School’s church and unleashed dozens of rounds through the windows, hitting children seated in the pews for
morning Mass just before 8.30 am.A smoke bomb was later discovered in a vehicle believed to belong to the suspect in the church parking lot.
Who are the victims?
Police said the two children killed in the attack were aged eight and ten. Fourteen other students and three
parishioners in their 80s sustained injuries, though officials added that all are expected to survive.
What is the identity of the suspected attacker?
Authorities identified the attacker as 23-year-old Robin M. Westman, a resident of suburban Minneapolis.
According to court documents, Westman was previously known as Robert Paul Westman and had petitioned to
change the name in 2019, when still a juvenile. The application, filed by Westman and supported by mother Mary
Grace Westman, stated that the teenager “identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that
identification.” The request was granted by a Dakota County court in January 2020.
FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed that the gunman was born Robert and later identified as Robin. While some
reports, including the New York Post, described the shooter as a transgender woman, officials noted that it
remains unclear whether Westman continued to identify that way in recent years.
'Nuke India, kill Trump' messages found on weapons
The 23-year-old attacker was reportedly carrying firearms inscribed with multiple incendiary messages, including“NUKE INDIA”, according to American far-right activist Laura Loomer, who shared pictures of the weapons on
social media.
Other phrases allegedly scrawled on the guns and magazines included “Suck On This!”, “Mashallah”, “ISRAEL
MUST FALL”, “Like a Phoenix we rise from the ash”, “Born to Shit, Forced to Wipe”, “6 million wasn’t enough” and
“Kill Donald Trump.”
Loomer suggested the shooter may have been influenced by “anti-Indian and anti-Jewish Islamic propaganda”
and linked the attack to what she described as the “Red-Green alliance,” while also noting that the suspect lived
in a district represented by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.
However, Minneapolis police have not independently verified these claims.
What is Annunciation Catholic Church school connection?
Annunciation Catholic Church caters to students from preschool to Grade 8, or up to the age of 14, according to
its official website. The institution follows a faith-based learning model, with religion forming the cornerstone of
its teaching approach.
Police said the gunman’s mother, Mary Grace Westman, had previously worked at Annunciation School.
According to a church blog and a Facebook post, she served as a secretary at the Minneapolis institution for five
years before retiring in 2021.
Shooter released 'manifesto' video hours before the attack
Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed that shooter Robin Westman had uploaded a series ofdisturbing videos to YouTube just hours before the attack, including a manifesto that is now under investigation.
In one 20-minute clip, the 23-year-old is seen leafing through the handwritten document, which contained
fantasies about “being that scary horrible monster standing over those powerless kids” and included praise for
the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre.
Officials described the writings as “deranged” and said they are being examined to help establish a possible
motive. The videos and the manifesto have since been taken down by authorities, who are working with federal
investigators to review the content in detail.
Motive behind killing?
While Minneapolis police have said the motive behind the attack at Annunciation Church remains unclear, the
FBI has categorised the incident as domestic terrorism and a hate crime.
FBI Director Kash Patel announced on social media platform X that the bureau was formally investigating the
shooting as “an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics.”
Trump orders flag at half mast
Following Minneapolis shooting on August 27, US President Donald Trump has ordered that the American flag be
flown at half-staff across all federal buildings and installations until sunset on August 31.
In an official proclamation, the White House said: “As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of
violence perpetrated on August 27, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota... I hereby order that the flag of the United
States shall be flown at half-staff… until sunset, August 31, 2025.”The directive applies not only to the White House and all public buildings across the United States but also to US
embassies and military installations worldwide.
Community shattered by “senseless” violence
Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the attack had “deeply traumatised the community.” Mayor Jacob Frey
emphasised that the children had been “literally praying” when the attack began, urging Americans not to
reduce the tragedy to “thoughts and prayers” alone.
The wider debate
The city has been grappling with a spike in homicides since the 2020 police killing of George Floyd, which
triggered nationwide unrest and left the Minneapolis Police Department dealing with staff shortages.
Authorities clarified that the assault at Annunciation Church did not appear to be connected to three other
shootings reported in Minneapolis within the previous 24 hours, including one at a Jesuit high school.
Minnesota has also witnessed episodes of political violence. In May this year, a gunman impersonating a police
officer carried out targeted killings, fatally shooting the Democratic state House speaker and her husband and
injuring a Democratic state senator and his wife. Authorities described the attack as an assassination attempt,
and the accused has since pleaded not guilty to federal murder charges.
