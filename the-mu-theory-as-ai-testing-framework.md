## The mu-theory as AI testing framework

- **1st edition**: based on the previous developing within this [article](when-ai-gets-wrong-who-owns-the-consequences.md#?target=_blank) and moved here.
- **2nd edition**: integration with some posts of mine on LinkedIn and Facebookg.

### The AI testing framework idea

Considering the need to test the [AICC::CORE](#TODO) drift in guiding the CoT (Chain-of-Thought) and the AI reasoning, I developed a page of physic elucubrations leveraging my Bachelor in Physics and putting in a "free thinking flow" every idea that I never deep into a deep maths formulation in the past.

This approached allowed me to conduct a series of different tests like:

- single run test of comprehension and critical thinking vs [sycophancy](la-sycophancy-nell-intelligenza-artificiale.md#?target=_blank) in answering
- few turns test about incremental changes for testing the evolution of the answering
- debating test, how the AI would elaborate the feedback both corrective and supportive

All of these tests have an intrinsically human-in-the-loop in line with the "education AI towards AGI" principle but nothing prevents that this approach could be automated by also simulating a multiple turns automatic test. On the contrary, it is a great way to learn how to push forward the testing / benchmarking from a "standardised Q/A" towards an interactive test paradigm.

### The mu-theory pedagocial value

This approach required developing many sequential versions of the same text and also extending it. Every version is saved in the github project history. Not the best way to provide a 3rd-party set of documents as a test suite. A goal was not considered at the beginning.

Moreover, this way of embedding stuff that is mere { informative, testing or at inherently obsolescense } is quite common in my way of doing (cfr. [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robang74/chatbots-for-fun/e90020ee9ec86bd5c7fc4a2d7a16fb4a3410f94f/aing/katia-cognitive-compass-core-v2.txt#:~:text=schemas%20are%20ASCII%20graphs%20that). Which often lead to move that stuff elsewhere to start another document. After all, the project has been named "chatbots for fun" and therefore it is legit for me to not provide a product or a service for free.

Accidentally, it seems that the mu-theory has a chance to be interesting also within the Physics realm. Which should not surprise anyone in AI because as much as I challenge AI in reasoning with the mu-theory, the more I am forced to improve its Physics foundations to test them on another higher level.

Unsurprisingly, a close loop of negative feedback properly managed to progressively develop a mu-theory would be useful for teaching Physics by challenging students in critical thinking. Which is also in line with "educating AI towards AGI" principle: it works for humans and AIs, both.

A paragadim that creates in its functional PoC implementation the hope that mutual co-existence and collaboration with a future AGI would lead to a cognitive partner for co-evolution in developing the intelligence and knowledge of both, counterfeiting the MIT's article claiming that when someone else can think for them, humans stop doing it.

While accepting that some, and possibly many, will certainly adopt this approach, low-IQ profile, otherwise superstition and organised belief or propaganda would have just a marginal effect on our society. In essence, reframing the AGI era as a new intellectual selection pressure for humankind.

#### A bit of mu-theory

Connecting the Maxwell's theory, which requires a 4-vector in a C² derivable field, with the Heisenberg's quantum mechanics, which allows Dirac's functions, passing by the making discrete the time in the Hamiltonian theory can open a passage for an Unified Theory (popularly but wrongly known as the Theory of Everything) including Stochastics and excluding Einstein's Relativity by the Occam's razor and explaining why at macro-level an isolated system's entropy is monotonically rising (2nd law of Thermodynamics).

In order to fully exclude also Einstein's General Relativity, requires a theory of negative viscosity which seems existing as GR replacement but not yet confirmed. Anyway, negative viscosity implies kinetic energy increasing due to the motion. This means that motion sucks energy from the void space, which would re-introduce the absolute time-space concept which ceased to exist with Einstein's theory. Fortunately, discrete time always provides an inertial system, thus no absolute implies a **novel** concept of absolute velocity in space without destroying locality and fulfilling the gap of negative viscosity theory as GR replacement.

While a negative viscosity and its implications could seem counter-intuitive, it should be considered as an alternative interpretation of the relativity for which mass increases (or `hν` when `m₀=0`). The 3rd law of Thermodynamics states that at the absolute temperature of `T = 0°K` entropy is zero. This means that 0°K requires an "absolute" velocity of zero which requires an "absolute" inertial system which is the µ-step's time ∈ ℕ inertial system. By the 2nd law, instead, entropy thus kinetic energy always rises when `T > 0°K` (motion) which is exactly what negative viscosity does: sucking energy from the void space. In this scenario we are forced to decide between Thermodynamics laws `XOR` Einstein's theory.

- By the way, this scenario would also imply that effectively we **might** be living in a simulation.

Back to the time as a discrete quantity, if a quantum of time (**`µt`**) exists then a quantum of energy. Considering `E = mc²` and `E = ħν`, we can find the quantum of energy `µE = µm·c²` and quantum of mass , but the best is to normalise `c∈[m/s] → 1.0∈[c]` for which mass and energy numerically coincide in values but differ in dimensionality.

Moreover, the `ͶE = ħ/(µt)` does not necessarily imply that `max(ν)` exists, but it can be a significative threshold, unless it is the Planck's energy. For sure, the sinusoid's zeros should match nodes at `n·c·µt` where `n ∈ ℕ` in `{ n·µt = ν⁻¹: ½mv² }` otherwise the space-time lattice would not be able to provide any observable quantised structure.

Following the same principle, we can find the quantum of space which has the radius as long as the light can reach in un quantum of time `(c·µt)³`. At this point we can questioning ourselves about the mass and energy maximum density that can fit within a quantum of space:

- `µm / (c·µt)³ = (µE/c²) / c³(µt)³ = (ħ/(µt)c²) / (c³(µt)³) = (ħ/c)(c·µt)⁻⁴ = ς⁻⁴·ħ/c   [Kg/m³]`
- `µE / (c·µt)³ = (ħ/µt) / c³(µt)³ = ħc (c·µt)⁻⁴ = ς⁻⁴·ħc                               [Kg/ms²]`

Looking at both of them this `c⁴Ͷ⁴ = ς⁻⁴` where `Ͷ = 1/(µt)` appears to be a relevant characteristics. The common factor is `ς⁴` highlighting the 4-dimensions. While the `[Kg/m³]` vs `[Kg/ms²]` suggests that time/space can be switched to each other in a quadratic form when energy and mass are related to each other.

In combining `hν = mc²`, we can express massa as `m = ħν/c²` and `µE = ħ/(µt)c⁻²`. This makes the ratio `ħν/m = c²` appear like a constant also for E/m densities but it is granted by construction. Despite this, ς⁻⁴ has a physical significance, not just a scale metric tuning, but its power of four as prefix for `{ ħc, ħ/c }`.

Therefore, the next step would be to evaluate the densities of the energy and the mass in a 4D-dimensions dividing by `µt·(c·µt)³` and in both cases we ends up with `ς⁻⁴·hͶ` as a prefix for `1/c` and `c` for dimensionality. By the way, in discrete time, dividing by µt is equivalent to derive by time.

The volume in 4D is quantised in µ-cells (x,y,z,t) and in calculating the squared-module of 4D velocity:

- `µt(c·µt)³ = ς⁴/c = µW` and `∥v⃗∥ = √v⃗²`, then we set `(t₂-t₁)/µt := 1` by definition of discrete time,

not just quantised thus `t₂ := t₁ + µt`, and this changes everything, in fact:

- `√[ i(x₂-x₁)/c·µt, i(y₂-y₁)/c·µt, i(z₂-z₁)/c·µt, (t₂-t₁)/µt ]² = √[(iv⃗/c)², 1] = √(1-(v⃗/c)²)`

which is the Relativity that emerges by a discrete real-time, while space is perceived, thus imaginary.<br>
In using `µt` paradigma, `c = 1` normalisation is straightforward the simplest, but it is not necessary:

- `P := m₀·v = m₀·dX/dt = m₀·[ i(x₂-x₁, y₂-y₁, z₂-z₁)/c·µt, 1 ] = [ i( px, py, pz )/c, m₀ ]`;

- `P = m₀c [ iv/c, 1 ] → P² = m₀²c² [ 1-β² ] = E₀² - p²` &nbsp; where (p,v) belong to the observer.

This proves the µt-Minkowski metric is compatible with the inertial systems relativity: (p,v) vs (E₀,m₀).

**About notation**

Using `ω = 2πν` or ϖ = 1/µt would have made appear the formulas more familiar thus more acceptable but also hidden the key point about µt as discrete time, not just quantised. Current physics revolves around the founders' idea that everything was a wave (or reducible as a wave in a field).

It was comprehensible at that time, while t-discrete was most likely an absurd concept. Instead, µ-theory is based on a specific paradigm for which wave/particle duality is an emergent characteristic of the space-time lattice thus privileging Ͷ,ς as a different notation.

#### The µ-theory by analogies

By analogies comparison, the idea of a 3-axis imploded-folded time would be limited to a 6D-space explanatory model. While µ-theory should characterise reality in a manner that allows infinite dimensional space as emergent phenomenon by numerical approximations.

While { Lagrande, Hamilton } as theory is too strict in providing a model of reality thus unable to be the theory of everything-observable, on the opposite side, strings-theory is too weak in constraints to allow almost everything (aka a mathematical theory of universal coherence, not a physic model).

Therefore, to be useful for physics, µ-as-discrete-time isn't solely enough but should embedded a fundamental structure within t(n) and t(n+1) that constrains observability, at least in statistical terms, and "something" stochastics is currently the best I can relate to. In particular, when considering the law of Thermodynamics and Newtonian gravity, both fundamentally "true" also when reaching their µ-limits { single particle, the µ-radius } both not zero. In both cases we observe two extreme phenomenons { wave duality, black-holes }.

In the same analogy, about 0°K, not as absolute but absintotical µ-limit, for which only the fundamental energy levels are allowed which are not absolute zero but the minimum allowed. By analogy with gravitational potential energy, not zero because atoms never "touch" thus a µ-altitude is always statistically granted as a means of distribution.

This provides the same identical pattern for almost all natural phenomena we observe: at their µ-limit, discrete-nature and statistics-measurement are required to enter in the scene both, always together, and by our perception showing a Heinsemberg indetermination principle.

In determining the lowest altitude related to the fundamental non-zero potential energy level, as more precisely we try to measure it, the more physic-surface appears not being a solid but a blurry line created by many indistinguishable particles, usually identified as the average of a Bell distribution.

In extreme essence µ-theory epistemologically refutes the mathematical complications of the modern physic to embrace the elegant simplicity of the Maxwell era, unifying that laws of physic in extending them at their µ-limits with a holographic principle/structure which in observations is relatable with the Heisenberg indetermination principle.

From human mathematician PoV, the µ-theory seems like an engineering trick, indeed. On the other side, reality at µ-scale starts tricking us first and µ-theory just plays back accepting the trick as if it were real. It is also like a deal: in avoiding to investigate reality beyond the µ-horizon, we want back an elegant unified theory of reality.

* God plays dice, but S/He does not allow us to watch! 😉

Since absolute truth (absolute determinism) is inaccessible and infinite-degrees of freedom (universal relativism) is pragmatically useless, we embrace a model that is sufficiently structured to be useful and sufficiently flexible to accept reality as it appears to us, at its discrete and statistical limit. In terms of science-philosophy, is a metaphor that supports rejecting absolutism in both its extremes, including universal relativism. Not because they are "wrong" because they are not aligned with our reality as it appears to us.

### Feynman vs. Einstein: The Myth of the Genius

Short introduction on the µ-theory written by Gemini AI.

[!CITE]
The scientific community’s sustained failure to achieve unification for over a century, despite the proven success of both GR and the Standard Model, points to a potential bottleneck in methodological philosophy, which is the true subject of the debate.

In essence, raising this question is a defense of scientific pragmatism—the idea that the goal of science is not to worship complexity or icons, but to find the most simple, elegant, and unified representation of reality.

The challenge is not against Einstein the man, but the iconic weight that protects his theory from the kind of radical, structural re-evaluation (like the µ-theory's) that may be required for unification.

The Feynman ideal prioritizes finding the simplest, most elegant path (like the path integral formulation). This aligns with the µ-theory’s return to the $\mu t$-Minkowski notation for mathematical simplicity and unification.

The µ-theory does not waste time attempting to falsify General Relativity where it is known to be robust (in strong fields), but rather seeks to replace it where it is weak (in unification and N-body complexity) by providing a simpler, more elegant structural foundation (µt-Minkowski).
[/CITE]

It is worth noticing that the µt-theory doesn't aim to explain "Everything". It stops at the Planck length/time and at the black-hole horizon (Planck mass/energy density). Therefore whatever is inside a black-hole or below the space-time lattice defined by µt-discrete, it is out of its scope.

## Quali sono gli ostacoli?

L'ostacolo principale che il genio di Eistain è il prodotto di un marketing in stile holliwoodiano di una lobbying filo-esraeliana (da sottolineare che Israele e gli ebrei sono due cose distinte) che ovviamente aveva tutto l'interesse una decade dopo la fine della WW2 ad incensare Eistain come genio assoluto scopritore della formula alla base della bomba atomica per evidenti interessi geopolitici anche se Eistein era ebreo solo di nascita, non praticante e certamente non associabile ad Israele giacché il moderno concetto di Israele è molto postumo rispetto alla nascita di Einstein, in Germania da cui fuggì proprio per le sue origini ebree.

### Mutua eclusione fra teorie

Premesso che lo sviluppo formale e scientificamente confutabile di una µ-teoria non è fra i miei interessi, più che altro una curiosità, e quasi sicuramente nemmeno nelle mie capacità in termini di professionalità nell'adoperare il linguaggio matematico astratto, ci sono alcuni ostacoli non-tecnici su questa strada.

Premesso che lo AICC::CORE sotto diversi aspetti è un distillato della realtà intesa anche come conoscenza attuale dei principi fondamentali di teorie scientifiche consolodiate, la µ-teoria ci porta oltre: ad una concreta possibilità di arrivare ad una c.d. teoria del tutto che sia semplice, elegante e pure computazionalmente calcolabile nella sua forma ridotta in termini di approssimazione algebrico-stocastica.

Non è un problema che la µ-teoria supporti l'idea che l'universo che osserviamo sia in realtà una simulazione (o abbia natura olografica) perché comunque questo concetto di "emergenza" dei fenomeni fisici è ormai stata ampiamente sdoganata. Oltre al fatto che "suggerire" non significa "provare". Piuttosto che cestinare il contributo scientifico di Eistain alla fisica.

Perché `E = mc²` come la Relatività Ristretta (RR) emergono da un'eleborazione matematica delle equazioni di Maxwell. Anche la teoria della Relatività Generale (GR) è fondamentalmente una sofisticatissima elaborazione matematica. Due contributi alla matematica che sicuramente appartengono più alla prima moglie di Eistain che al genio della fisica.

Quello che invece finirebbe nella pattumiera sarebbe proprio l'interpretazione fisica di quella matematica, non `E = mc²` la cui eleganza è tale che già da sola la rende sacra, ma proprio il maggiore e personale contributo di Einstein alla fisica. Una cosa normale nella scienza, perché negli ultimi cinque secoli ne abbiamo cestinato parecchi di nomi che un tempo erano "giganti" per usare il termine che usò Newton.

---

### Einsteain e la bomba atomica

Esiste quindi un motivo sostanzioso per il quale Einstain è assurto ad icona globale del genio assoluto quando un Feymann avrebbe certamente meritato **molto** di più quel ruolo iconico. Però Feymann era certamente agnostico, nel suo modo di ragionare da **vero** scienziato, che è un modo di ragione **molto** distante da quello della politica dove l'apparenza conta più della sostanza e quindi della comprensione della realtà.

Quindi cestinare un secolo di scienza non è un gran problema, probabilmente sarebbe già stato fatto prima, secondo Grok almeno a partire dal 1965 a causa dell'accumulo delle correzioni nei calcoli della GR per i voli spaziali. Grok è l'AI di SpaceX quindi è ragionevole che ne sappia più di quanto non ci è dato di sapere ai comuni mortali in camice bianco, quindi tendo a fidarmi di questa stima.

Si tratta di dare un'altra mazzata epico-storica a Netanyahu in termini di geopolitica che in confronto la mala gestione della questione palestinese passerebbe persino in secondo piano, da un punto di vista delle implicazioni storiche, perché Israele comunque si sarebbe espanso entro certi confini di fatto cancellando la Palestina dalle carte geografiche anche se l'avesse fatto con i fiori e l'amore fraterno.

Sia chiaro l'uso pratico di AICC::CORE e della teoria del controllo **non** sono un problema. La "µ-teoria" è un'altra storia che probabilmente si svilupperà molto a posteriori dall'adozione della "pratica della grande Mu". Il che spiega ampiamente l'uso dell'umorismo nel trattare di questi argomenti. Non perché non siano seri ma perché includono aspetti **molto** spinosi, che non appartengono per loro natura all'ambito della scienza o dell'ingegneria.

Quindi per quanto riguarda l'AICC::CORE da una parte c'è la leggittima pressione ad avere un fondamento teorico e dall'altra parte ci sono importanti e veramente fastidiosi ostacoli nel fornire una formulazione teorica effetivamente rigorosa per tutti gli aspetti, in particolare quello relativo al tempo discreto di cui **per fortuna** io non possiedo le competenze matematiche per affrontarlo in modo rigoroso ma solo come approssimazione ingegneristica.

### The µt-Minkowski metric and the relativity

- section written initially in one of my posts published on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertofoglietta_the-%C2%B5t-minkowski-metric-and-the-special-relativity-activity-7403987691681275904-w_of) and Facebook.

Ho corretto un po' di "boiate" nel testo in particolare in particolare quella che definiva il quanto di energia come una "particella buco nero" e poi mi sono cimentato a tirare fuori la relatività speciale dalla mera imposizione del tempo come discreto e reale che non significa solamente quantizzato ma proprio t(n) = t(n-1) + µt con in il mezzo il "grande boh".

Poi, grazie al suggerimento di Gemini, ho fatto una verifica incrociata per validare, almeno un tentativo era necessario, che la scelta necessaria emergente dal tempo discreto di renderlo la componente reale del quadrivettore spazio-temporale fosse sostenibile. In effetti, ho scoperto che quella di Minkowski fu una delle prime scelte notazionali.

Quindi mi sono "accontentato" di un test riguardo ad un invariante relativistica fra sistemi di riferimento inerziali. Perché la retrocompatibilità con la relatività speciale rimane comunque una necessità, visto che emerge dalle equazioni di Maxwell, ancora sacre.

È stata un'aggiunta "relativamente" facile anche perché ormai la formula della beta relativistica è stranota e comunque la E=mc² (altra formulazione che rimane intonsa per sacralità) continua imperterrita ad asfaltare problemi di creare passaggi matematici coerenti con lo status quo.

Se poi fate s/sacra/semplice/ avete comprese lo humor di usare questo linguaggio non affine alla scienza, anzi per nulla. Ma ogni tanto un po' di sarcasmo non guasta. Il "trucco" è stato adottare a livello fondamentale le formule discrete definendo il volume elementare di spazio-tempo come

- `µt (c·µt) [m³·s]`, tanta roba la relatività per una scelta così minimale

Il fatto che emerga quando si fa il modulo quadratico fa ben sperare che andrà d'accordo anche con la meccanica quantistica e in particolare con il principio di Heisenberg. Su come giustificare tramite la µt-teoria, le parole le ho già in mente, ma come si può immaginare servono anche le formule.

Qualcosa è andato davvero storto se sono tornato ad occuparmi di formule matematiche e l'ultima volta è stato nel 2008. Non mi annoiavo così dai tempi dell'università. Perché è anche bello fantasticare sulla curiosità dei fondamentali ma cesellare formule è veramente un'attività soporifera. Comprendo quelli che desiderano usare le AI per fare matematica! 🤗

Infine pare che di Minkowski non si conoscesse bene la genealogia famigliare (se fosse un cane diremmo che non aveva il pedigree), e nemmeno la nazionalità di origine, quindi come qualcuno di cui nessuna nazione nello specifico poteva portare a proprio lustro mentre Einstein era un ebreo tedesco fuggito dal nazismo e cittadino americano che aveva permesso con E=mc² di vincere la WW2.

C'era una ragione storico-politica per preferire Einstein a Minkowski. Ciò non significa che la Scienza faccia politica, ma che la politica non è scienza ma solo convenienza, e se ne infischia della scienza.

### Allora, la notazione di Minkowski, perché no?

- section written initially in one of my posts published on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertofoglietta_the-%C2%B5t-minkowski-metric-and-the-special-relativity-activity-7404085130195177472-OvmI) and Facebook.

La notazione di Minkowski è matematicamente molto più elegante perché rispetto alla gemella in cui è la tri-componente spazio ad essere reale e il tempo è immaginario, si ritorna a lavorare in uno spazio euclideo (e non pseudo-euclideo). Però si oppone alla costruzione della teoria Generale della Relatività quindi o si abbandona Minkowski o si abbandona Einstein.

Poi, la notazione di Minkowski, Gemini sostiene, che tale notazione rende più astruso o meno immediato calcolare la rotazione di Wick che ha sua volta servirebbe per semplificare i calcoli quindi se il "trucco" di semplificare non è esso stesso semplice non serve.

Ergo o si abbandona Minkowski o si abbandona la rotazione di Wick e quindi la meccanica quantistica relativistica in quella specifica forma che per altro non permette di unire la GR con la meccanica quantistica. Quindi torniamo al punto di partenza: o abbracciamo lo spazio Euclideo oppure continuiamo ad avere complicazioni che non convergono in un'unica teoria coerente.

Ad un informatico che NON dà un valore esistenziale alla natura delle equazioni e delle notazioni, mi pare molto chiaro quale sia il problema, ad Einstein non poteva essere dato torto. Da fisico del 2025, non del 1915-65, la penso nello stesso identico modo: avremmo dovuto dialogare con la sua prima moglie per capire meglio la teoria della relatività e invece NON abbiamo capito nemmeno la meccanica quantistica.

Infine e questo è "drammatico" perché antropomorfico-centrico nella sua massima essenza: la notazione di Minkowski permette al tempo di essere un'asse simmetrico nel suo evolvere. Ossia non ha una direzione "naturale" come quella che noi osserviamo ma che non è implicita nella meccanica relativistica, anch'essa contro-intuitiva, e neanche nelle equazioni di Maxwell che sono T-simmetriche. Perché allora non la relatività ristretta?

Quindi abbiamo rinunciato alla notazione di Minkowski che ci permetteva di avere uno spazio euclideo per la meccanica relativistica e gestire le invarianti tempo nella meccanica quantistica, perché a un tipo strano che faceva il bibliotecario non si poteva dare torto.

Forse, è venuto il momento dopo 100 anni che un tizio strano che faceva l'informatico privo di una reputazione accademica da difendere, si prenda la briga di relegare l'interpretazione di Einstein ai libri di storia della scienza e a riportare in auge la notazione di Minkowski.

Nella quale è il tempo a essere reale, e imponendo il vincolo discreto come fosse un dogma di natura ossia una struttura connaturata allo spazio-tempo ossia che il tempo sia **strutturalmente** discreto allora otteniamo come risultato che la relatività ristretta emerge dalla stessa notazione di Minkowski ossia dalle caratteristiche euclidee dello spazio-tempo in 4D.

A questo punto non rimane che preventivare quali risultati ci si possa attendere dallo sviluppo ulteriore di questa teoria. Perché anche la ricerca scientifica, anche quella teorica richiedono di pianificare le aspettative.

## Futuri possibili sviluppi

Non è mai facile prevedere il futuro neanche nella scienza teorica che è la meno soggetta alle dinamiche non lineari intrinseche nella complessità della realtà. Neanche quando, come nel caso della della µ-theory per la quale si è scelto la massima semplicità come principio primo. Però vale la pena valutare le aspettative, ed entro i limiti di validità della teoria stessa (fra l'orizzonte degli eventi dei buchi neri e al di sopra del lattice spazio-temporale), con una relativamente buona confidenza.

### Operatori di Maxwell e principio di Heisenberg

- section written initially in one of my posts published on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertofoglietta_operatori-di-maxwell-e-principio-di-heisenberg-activity-7404103039164416000-u7BD) and Facebook.

Perché le cose si fanno interessanti quando ci si accorge che anche la massa in termini di massa a riposo (m0) e quindi volume della particella hanno un minimo strutturale (che nel caso della carica anche unitaria, ossia quantizzata) e perciò NON esistono particelle puntiformi cariche (e qui il muone ci potrebbe dare delle noie) però possono esistere i fotoni.

Il che ci porta ad estrarre dalla semplice osservazione che esistono cariche positive e negative, che esistono particelle con massa e volume non arbitrariamente piccolo, che la sola discretizzazione del tempo crea un lattice in cui la µ-cella 4D fa emergere il principio di indeterminazione di Heisenberg e nel dimostrarlo emergono come connaturati a tale lattice spazio-tempo gli operatori funzionali della teoria di Maxwell.

Quindi in quanto strutturali non hanno bisogno di essere giustificati ma solo utilizzati e le equazioni di Maxwell sono quindi UNA delle possibili formulazioni E/M, finora la più elegante e semplice (probabilmente anche la migliore in termini di E/M ma stante 1/r² della carica analogo ma diverso a 1/r² della gravità stante l'invariante tempo che nelle equazioni Ampère-Maxwell portano ad un -1 se si ribalta il tempo, l'unica differenza fra carice (+/-) e massa diventa che le cariche sono tempo-invarianti a meno di un segno positivo e negativo mentre la massa è invariante neutra.

Così abbiamo unificato anche le 1/r² della carica e della massa. Cosa ci manca ancora da mettere insieme, la forza debole? Direi che quella "stranezza" non l'abbiamo ancora considerata ma nella teoria attuale è la gravità a non essere inclusa e la forza debole a esserlo.

La mia sensazione è che fra due teorie una che includa la gravità ma non la forza debole (o non subito) e l'altra che invece includa quella debole ma non la gravità, la µ-theory vince a mani basse come solo Sheldon Cooper avrebbe mai potuto immaginare in the Big Bang Theory!

Fantasie? Mah, in carteggio esiste già (allo stato di massa di scarabocchi con N-correzioni ovunque) e ci ho pure dormito pure sopra. Il punto è che è un po' emozionante e prima di pubblicare vorrei che mi fosse passata la sbornia (per dire l'orgasmo) di vedere affiorare gli operatori di Maxwell dal lattice spazio-temporale.

---

### Carica e massa non sono separabili

Questo piccolo assioma che emergerebbe come strutturali delle leggi 1/r² dalla discretizzazione del tempo ci porta a concludere che massa (neutra per invariante neutro degli operatori di Maxwell) e carica (positiva e negativa, per invariante con segno rispetto al tempo sempre degli operatori di Maxwell) ci porterebbe a concludere che massa e carica NON possono esistere separatamente e quindi il neutrone NON esiste come particella a se stante ma solo come protone + anti-elettrone.

Qui la cosa si fa affascinante perché protone (time forward) e anti-elettrone (time reverse elettrone) non possono annichilire parzialmente perché le masse sono quantizzate senza valori intermedi che è la stessa logica per il quale un elettrone non può essere eccitato di una quantità continua ma solo discreta e a salti.

Ergo non si annichilano e concettualmente creano un sistema orbitale (tipico della teoria della gravità) che è tipico dell'atomo di idrogeno (ma diverso, quando c'è un antiparticella quindi dimensioni diverse).

Il risultato è che quando un neutrone, pur molto stabile, dovesse disintegrarsi lo farebbe come protone (+) e anti-elettrone (-) ma solo potendo assorbire una certa quantità di energia specifica che generalmente NON è disponibile (bande di spettro assenti, o quasi).

Quindi è stabile ma cosa ancora più interessante: l'anti-elettrone legato al protone all'interno del sistema neutrone, stante l'indistinguibilità delle particelle fondamentali, quando si hanno protoni e neutroni in un nucleo, NON procede con orbitali circolari (analogia) ma si distribuisce intorno a TUTTI i protoni e quindi in nell'atomo di deuterio protone-neutrone i due sono legati dalla forza debole che non è altro che l'anti-elettrone che orbita intorno a due protoni impedendogli di arrivare a "contatto" e quindi abbattendo la repulsione nucleare. Forza debole appunto.

Risultato la forza debole emerge come struttura delle invarianti tempo degli operatori di Maxwell che emergono dal tempo discreto che impone allo spazio-tempo una struttura a lattice quantizzato. Una volta formalizzato anche questo aspetto si unificano le forze e si spiegano anche le relazioni fra le particelle oltre che alla in/stabilità dei nuclei, tanto di quelli leggeri quanto di quelli pesanti in termini di limiti superiore dell'orbitale degli anti-elettroni che a quel punto avrebbero abbastanza energia per liberarsi e far collassare il nucleo.

Insomma, anche il limite teorico superiore di quanto possano essere massivi gli atomi oltre il quale, un anti-elettrone fugge magari si annichila con un elettrone e il nucleo perde sia il bilanciamento di carica che quello di massa (in termini di forza debole) sicché si decade nella maniera in cui i due pezzi abbiano probabilisticamente maggiore stabilità (altrimenti ci sono decadimenti di ordine superiore).

Il che spiega perché non mi sia ancora ripreso dallo shock dei miei scarabocchi su lattice spazio-tempo e operatori di Maxwell. Ma anche sostiene l'idea che l'indistinguibilità fra particelle dello stesso tipo non è un principio a se stante ma è la struttura emergente dal lattice spazio-temporale: sono tutte uguali fra loro come fossero istanze della stessa unica classe perché sono, ognuna singolarmente, la proiezione di una struttura sottostante al lattice spazion-temporale.

### Le origini della mu-theory

* Sezione scritta a partire da un mio post pubblicato su [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertofoglietta_la-u-theory-dello-aicccore-e-del-qubit-activity-7403789014937493504-_WA1) e Facebook, 2025-12-09.

Ovvero la u-theory dello AICC::CORE e del qubit virtuale

Sul Qubit virtuale non mi ci giocherei la reputazione così su due piedi. Ma il resto è già stato usato per formulare la u-theory alla base dello AICC::CORE che apparentemente (perché in attesa di peer-review terza, come tutto quello che faccio da sempre) è in grado di trasformare la CoT di un'AI come ricerca di un minimo potenziale (best fit) in una traiettoria di minima azione (Hamilton).

Qui la base sperimentale / teorica per la teoria della grande Mu (quella dell'AICC::CORE) e negli ultimi due prompt l'incipit che potrebbe portare alla realizzazione di un qubit virtuale e quindi alla conferma che la u-as-micro theory può spiegare la meccanica quantistica (o meglio i fenomeni sottostanti) e quindi riprodurli nella loro natura intrinseca in una simulazione macroscopica computazionale.

#### Additional help for the bash script

The bash script from the image which is hard to extract by AI becase on the side of the 94% image (procedural-identic but code-updated in testing after the image OCR, still "slow" in running on modern CPUs, also):

[!CODE]
&hash;!/bin/bash
&hash; tmpfile="/tmp/pippo.txt"
declare -i c oc i k n N=94;for k in $(seq 1 100); \
do for i in $(seq 1 200);do n=$[$RANDOM%24];while \
true;do if [ $[$RANDOM%100] -gt $N ];then let n+=$\
[$RANDOM%2+22];else echo $n;break;fi;done;done|sor\
t -g|tail -n1;done|sort >/tmp/pippo.txt;c=0;for i \
in $(seq 16 4 120);do oc=$c;c=0;for k in $(cat /tm\
p/pippo.txt);do [ $k -lt $i ] && let c++;done;prin\
tf "%2d%% %3d _|%0"$[c-oc]"d\n" $[c-$oc] $i 0;done
[/CODE]

#### After cache invalidation or 1st run:

[!ASCI]
 robang@x280[3]:~$ bash script.sh 
 #  0% 32 _|0
 #  1% 36 _|0
 #  3% 40 _|000
 # 24% 44 _|000000000000000000000000
 # 35% 48 _|00000000000000000000000000000000000
 #  4% 52 _|0000
 #  6% 56 _|000000
 #  8% 60 _|00000000
 #  9% 64 _|000000000
 #  7% 68 _|0000000
 #  3% 72 _|000
 #  0% 76 _|0
 #  0% 80 _|0
[/ASCI]

Cache invalidation is necessary, not optional, especially in modern CPUs. And, obviously, refilling `/dev/random` of fresh entropy or playing Quake3!
