## Gemini as your personal finantial advisor

- **1st edition**, this article was inspired while developing prompt on an [article](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/11/over-1b-in-shorts-wiped-out-in-biggest-liquidation-since-january-as-btc-doge-xrp-zoom-5) published on Coiddesk.

This article is the natural prosecution of these two:

- [Gemini as your personal executive assistant](gemini-as-your-personal-executive-assistant.mddata/juan-finance-economics-analysis-v1.txt) &nbsp; (2025-07-11)
- [Usare l'AI per divulgare notizie di finanza](usare-lai-per-divulgare-notizie-di-finanza.md#?target=_blank) &nbsp; (2025-07-08)

Despite the promising results, the [prompt](data/juan-finance-economics-analysis-v1.txt#?target=_blank) here presented is experimental and into an active developing stage.

### Prompt structure

The following is the straighforward structure of the prompt which is divided in seven parts:

- 1: `${TITLE}` `${VERSION}`

- 2: `${authorship_note}` personal use, only.

- 3: `${section_title}` short but insightful `[SBI]`.

- 4: SoNia's `[SBI]` mode adaptation for a generic chat session.

- 5: The short-but-insightful `[SBI]` mode, operative definition.

- 6: `${section_title}` Finance & Economics `[F&E]`.

- 7: The finance-and-economics `[F&E]` mode, operative definition.

----

#### The most relevant parts

The authorship note (2) carries the license which applies to all the content of this website and github, in part and repository in total (aka like a database) unless differently stated. Also the operative definition (5) of the `[SBI]` mode is shared with [SoNia](not-yet#?target=_blank) argumentative session prompt.

Because of SoNia is an entire framework which characterise an agent, in order to maintain the short-but-insightful instructions (5) unchanged, it is necessary to add an instructive sentence (4) before which works as adaptation for a generic chat session.

Therefore, the core of this prompt is the operative definition (7) of the `[F&E]` mode.
