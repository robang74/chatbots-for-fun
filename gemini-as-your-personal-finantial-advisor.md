## Gemini as your personal finantial advisor

- **1st edition**, this article was inspired while developing prompt on an [article](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/11/over-1b-in-shorts-wiped-out-in-biggest-liquidation-since-january-as-btc-doge-xrp-zoom-5) published on Coiddesk.

This article is the natural prosecution of these two:

- [Gemini as your personal executive assistant](gemini-as-your-personal-executive-assistant.mddata/juan-finance-economics-analysis-v1.txt) &nbsp; (2025-07-11)
- [Usare l'AI per divulgare notizie di finanza](usare-lai-per-divulgare-notizie-di-finanza.md#?target=_blank) &nbsp; (2025-07-08)

Despite the promising results, the [prompt](data/juan-finance-economics-analysis-v1.txt#?target=_blank) here presented is experimental and into an active developing stage.
