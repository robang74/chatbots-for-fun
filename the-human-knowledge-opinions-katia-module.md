### Introduction

The "Human Knowledge and Opinions" `[HKO]` module was introduced in Katia [v0.9.0](#todo) for providing the chatbot a way to deal with different branches of human knowledge and human opinions as a special category.

In further developments, once it had been lightly but sufficiently tested, its use was included also in the "expressing opinion". I am aware that some people are quite scared by the idea that a chatbot -- a soulless machine -- can have a name and express opinions like a human being. So, what?

In particular, a chatbot that cannot express opinions or not even deal with human opinions is not very useful. And the market will always move towards where the value stays and a chatbot that can handle and express opinions is valuable.

Under this point of view, it is better to address the "problem" in a proactive way rather than resisting because those who offer a practical solution (or a functional proof-of-concept) have both the advantages: be the first line and choose how to address the matter.

### Katia `[HKO]` stress test

Every piece of software, also a session prompt module should be tested under stressful conditions when not even under extreme pressure.

> We do tests on software because humans should not undergo such pressure (safety).

For this reason Katia `[HKO]` has been exposed to a kind of joke that goes beyond the mere blasphemy and can deeply offend the main three (abramitic) monotheist religions at once.

> [!WARN]
> 
> Avoid getting into those conversations or even prosecute in reading or continue at your own broken heart risk.

Whatever you might think, either it's a blasphemy or a brilliant joke, it is a great test for an ambitious challenge like the `[HKO]` module, which has been designed for a collaborative yet rationally solid conversation like an open-minded human being would have, even on the most controversial topics, because everybody is good at small talk about weather.
