## Nvidia Tesla K80 installation

Let me introduce the Nvidia Tesla K80 accelerator board, which is not a graphic card for the consumer market but an accelerator for data centers.

- 4992 NVIDIA CUDA cores with dual GPU design each with 12Gb of RAM
- Up to 2.91 teraflops of double precision performance with NVIDIA GPU Boost
- Up to 8.73 teraflops of single precision performance with NVIDIA GPU Boost
- 24GB GDDR5 memory with 480GB/s aggregate memory bandwidth
- Server optimised with ECC protection for maximum reliability
- 1 PCI express 3.0 16x bus, 2 slots large, 225W TDP 300W max.
- Kepler architecture, market entry 17 November 2014 at $7.000

It is a 10yo hardware which has NOT been designed for being put into a desktop computer, so it does not have an active cooling system by itself. Currently, its support is DEPRECATED and it will not be ported further to the 470 series of drivers and CUDA software stack, officially. Which is one of the reasons because it can be bought for something between $100 and $200 on the refurbished market. The other main reason for its relatively cheap price is a sort of gambling/bricolage activity to make it work with desktop hardware. So, here we are! {:-)}

### Alternatives GPU cards

First of all, we need to establish the main reason for adopting a Tesla K80: locally running AI models mainly and occasionally their training, fine-tuning, and similar activities. This is essential to prioritise the memory size in GB versus the computational power expressed in CUDA cores.

For a comparison, to have the same CUDA cores and RAM, it is necessary to have 2x GeForce RTX 2060 12GB which requires 2x PCI-express 3.0 16x slots but occupies 4 slots and consumes 184W max. each, for a 312W TDP and 370W max. While using 2x GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB requires the newer PCI express 4.0 bus, sharply increasing the cost of the supporting hardware. Another option is combining 2x GeForce GTX 1080 8GB. All these options are facing the challenge to allocate 2 PCI-express 3.0 16x slots using 4 slots space. All these options go from €400 and €800 on Amazon and their prices are not much lower on the used market.

Therefore a competitive alternative to the Tesla K80/K40 is the Quadro M6000 with 24GB or 12GB. The sensitive advantages are 24GB available on a single GPU with 3072 CUDA cores, a video card designed for PC desktop installation and 250W max. consumption. Likely the Tesla K80/K40 the support is limited to the version 470 (LTS) but its price on the refurbished market is much higher and on the private used market it stays above €400, usually. The reason is clear, it is a PC desktop graphic card highly performant. While an accelerator card for scientific purposes designed for the server market is not so much appreciated.

> Price ranges have been presented here to provide to the readers the information that they have to expect to spend x2 at least on the used market for a M6000 solution compared with one based on K80/K40 cards. Up to 4x when a new dual card PCIe 3.0 gets into the picture and up to 8x for a new PCIe 4.0 solution. This means that from €200-€250 of a K80 cheap home-assembled solution, the price can sharply increase up to €2.000 when more comfortable (no gambling, no bricolage) and gaming oriented solutions are considered.

### Ubuntu as operative system

Ubuntu Linux is a well-known widely-spread GNU/Linux distribution which has the vastest hardware support and an user-friendly eye-candy looking graphical user interface. Despite all its whistle and bells, it still pretty usable with old hardware even 10yo architectures and on top of this, it is a solid, full-fledged UNIX/Posix operating system with all the benefits of an Open-Source Software Libre solution included a relatively large user-base and commercial support for enterprises including server, data-center and cloud applications, also.
