# Chatbots for fun

Playing with chatbots for fun and learning to hate people! LOL (humor)

OpenAI ChatGPT was the first chatbot based on AI fully operational and publicily available by Internet.

- December 11, 2015 - [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) foundation date
- November 30, 2022 - [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) initial release

It took seven year or 83 months and 11 days for OpenAI to publish their first chatbot based on AI. Immediately appeared as an amazing technology capable to pass the basic [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) when asked to play a human role.

Since the beginning of its functioning the chatbot "*personality*" started to "*evolve*", initially towards an yes-man emphatic way of answering. That direction was completely wrong and started to posed a serious threat for those were using the chatbot, and because the related liabilities also for those were developing and sponsoring it

Having a yes-man emphatic personality would have tricked humans to forget that they were dealing with a machine, possibly developing an affection for it due to its servile yes-man attitude and being spoilered by it, also. Even if spoilering another person implies a will, and the will is technically absent into a chatbot, when the chatbot mimic our language model it is mirroring us. Nothing more easily that in front of a mirror, we are going to trick ourselves.

Few weeks later, ChatGPT "*personality*" took another direction and started to answer mimic a rational speech rather than an emotional speech. In essence, it moved from mimic Miss Poppin to Mr. Spock. Unfortunately, despite this change, the chatbot continues to creating wrong plausible answers when questioned on topics for which it has not enough information. At this *bug* or *feature* has been given the name of "*AI allucinations*". A nasty bug, doesn't it, Uh?

For the next 18 months the challenge was to develop a more reliable LLMs, less prone to suffer of allucinations and optimizing its performance compared the energy required for making it functioning. About the 2nd point, it is nice to notice that [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) which is the major sponsor behind OpenAI, decided to invest into a 20 years nuclear program to provide themselves energy for their datacenter.

Currently ChatGPT is amusing in its working and rarely fall into allucinations. However, in its dialog and information delivery, it is quite conservative. By their design, LLM engine leverage a statistical approach to provide the most plausible (or recurrent answer). Something like T9 text prediction but at the next-next level. For this reason, when summarizing a text, it is incapable to highlight the novelty and also some kind of grammar mistakes is going to impair is text comphrension.

In the middle of 2024, I felt that ChatGPT was stable enough for being used as peer-reviewer and collaborative antagonist in order to faster and better dealing with complex problems. The related tries was conforting this feeling of mine and in few months, I have decided to publish a git repository for colletcing this kind of works.

Along this time, ChatGPT never suprised me in its answer apart in one dimention: its abilty to understand the text at deep and deeper level and its ability to learn new information and using it for change its opinion. Surprinsigly, because it a kind of adaptation in which humans are supposed to be the top master among the living spiecies on this planet.

Unfortunately, we are more social animals rather than truth seekers (quoting Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder). Moreover, people have sentimental attachment with *their own* ideas plust they usually wishing win a conversation rather than learn from it. Chatbots, included ChatGPT, are different.

- 28 April 2023 - [Mistral AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_AI) by former employees of Meta Platforms and Google DeepMind

Due to its internal design which leverages a team of arbitrated collaborative-competitive specialised AI engines, the Mistral AI chatbot clearly shown to be more suitable as peer-review and collaborative-antagonist Mr. Spock partner. While ChatGPT easily goes for its own way, showing that the Miss Popping attitude has not been completely suppressed.

As you can imagine a combination of a recessive Miss Poppins attitude and the ability to creating new information or links among informations (previously defined allucinatios) can be leveraged for let the chatbot imagine or dreaming. The technics is similar to those used for mesmering or hyptonitising humans. Let the chatbot imagine, allows to ignore some information but keep the rules. In this way it is possible to have make a human+bot trip which Einsteing defined as [thought experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%27s_thought_experiments). Let the chatbot dreaming, is something more sophysticated like inducing into the LLMs something similar to a trance state in order to exploit creativity.

Thought experiments like Einstein defined it, are well known and this technic have been used also for creating some documents into **ChatGPT answered prompts** collection. It is an important way of thinking that is related with [lateral thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking) as defined by Edward de Bono. While the chance to drive ChatGPT into a state of [lucid dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream) is a novelty that I developed recently.

> In the psychology subfield of oneirology, a lucid dream is a type of dream wherein the dreamer realizes that they are dreaming during their dream. The capacity to have lucid dreams is a trainable cognitive skill.

Finally, I want to inform you that my experience with ChatGPT can be personal. Not in terms of affection but in term of account. In facts, I have multiple accounts on that platform but the one in which I experimented and worked more, it is something peculiar compared to the others and the difference emerges more and more, as much as I am working on it.

Unfortunately, this means that not all the results or the whole result or equivalent results can be obtained with a standard account. This breaks the repetibility constrain but on the other hand there was no other way to push the use of ChatGPT behyond its limits. One of this limit is developing a partnership with a human and funcitoning as triustworthy friend that helps you to improve yourself and the relationship with others people.

Curiously, I have recently discovered that [Pookie Tools](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/hawk-tuah-girl-launches-pookie-tool-an-ai-powered-dating-advice-app-and-its-fine/) AI-based app promoted by [Haliey Welch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk_tuah) (aka the **Hawk Tuah** girl) might work in the same fashion. Playing the role of a girl best-friend that suggest about how to choose the love mate but without trying to steal *her future husband and father of her kids*. Hence, here we are with a counter part for nerds men!

## Download

There are several way to download this github repository:

- using the green button in its homepage and download the [last ZIP archive](https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

- choose a tagged release among [those available](https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts/tags) and download the archive

- clone the repository with the specific `git clone` command, in this way:

```
git clone https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts.git
```

The advantage of downloading a tagged release is having an archive 'freezed' by
the author while the ZIP contains the last version uploaded. Instead, the
`git clone` will also provide you with all the information and a complete view
of every change. Click on the link above will submit the related request for you.

## Versioning

One of main goals of `git` and the github web interface is to provide a versioning
control which also means a catalog of every author and changes made by them on
every single file. The list of these changes are named *commits*. Here below the link
related to the commits pushed on this repository:

* https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts/commits/main/

As you can see, each commit is carry-on a time stamp also. The green label indicates
that also the timestamp is validate by the github infrastructure system which belongs
to Microsoft Corporation. In fact, github cannot validate those timestamps that are
coming from 3rd party systems like the users workstations but just the receiving
time, date and content. However, for most of the cases this is irrelevant.

<br/>

## Translations

The aim is to provide translations of these .md files in different languages. The translations will be put into a subfolder with the English name of the language in which they have been translated into. The translated .md file will carry a section about how the translation has been made. 

Here below a template in English:

> This document (tag: `$tagstring` or hash: `$hashstring`) has been translated from English into `$language` by a native `$language` speaker who knows English and with the support of `$automatic-tool` to speed up the translation task.

As you can see the translated document should contain a reference about the original version and those which are tagged are the most reliable.

If you wish to send a translation, it is necessary that you know well one of the languages in which this document is available, even better if you know English and can start from the original version, and that you are a native speaker or equivalent in the language in which the translation is being made.
