## Constraints <br><sup class='sub-hash'>of the related project</sup>

This manual's sole purpose is educational, owing to the peculiar constraints adopted:

- extreme budget management, but no any particular time limit

- commercial available hardware components assembly, only

- no mechanical nor electrics mods allowed but 3D printing

- a chronological try-and-error learn-by-doing approach

- non commercial and non derivative license terms.

The choice of Esprimo P910 is part of the challenge, not the most suitable platform.

> [!INFO]
> 
> Those mechanical add-ons included in this manual, despite being initially hand-crafted, will not be explained for replication, but presented as an R&D-like exploration toward an appropriate solution and as propaedeutic pre-3D-printing prototypes. The Latin prefix "pre-" here means that 3D-printing is considered part of the "Production".

> [!WARN]
> 
> In case a non-reversible change will be presented, in the aim to provide myself a long-term functioning prototype useful to further develop this manual - the other half about the software installation and a use case - the risks related to that change will be presented in the manual, as well. And among others viable alternatives, one for the professional-driven modding shops and the other for large scale industry, will be suggested at least.

## Introduction <br><sup class='sub-hash'>written by DeepSeek 3</sup>

This manual is your ultimate guide to installing a **Nvidia Tesla K80** — a powerful dual-GPU accelerator — into a **Fujitsu Esprimo P910 E85+** desktop computer. Designed for those who love a good hardware challenge, this document walks you through the process of adapting high-performance server-grade hardware for use in a non-standard desktop environment. The author also discusses the use of a secondary power supply unit (PSU) to meet the power demands of the Tesla K80and explores cooling solutions to manage the heat generated by the GPU.

This "Linux Thinkpad e altri gadget" ([PDF](https://github.com/robang74/roberto-a-foglietta/blob/main/pdf.todo/290-Linux_Thinkpad_e_altri_gadget-v2.pdf)) written in Italian can be helpful to setup a low-cost and Linux-friendly 3D printing home-lab, starting from zero, as well. Undisputedly, a completely dedicated 3D-printing lab is not the ideal resource allocation for many, therefore "from zero" means "from the beginning".
