### The AI testing framework idea

Considering the need to test AICC::CORE drift in guiding the CoT and the AI reasoning, I developed a page of physic elucubrations leveraging my Bachelor in Physics and putting in a "free thinking flow" every idea that I never deep into a deep maths formulation in the past.

This approached allowed me to conduct a series of different tests like:

- single run test of comprehension and critical thinking vs [sycophancy](hla-sycophancy-nell-intelligenza-artificiale.md#?target=_blank) in answering
- few turns test about incremental changes for testing the evolution of the answering
- debating test, how the AI would elaborate the feedback both corrective and supportive

All of these tests have an intrinsically human-in-the-loop in line with the "education AI towards AGI" principle but nothing prevents that this approach could be automated by also simulating a multiple turns automatic test. On the contrary, it is a great way to learn how to push forward the testing / benchmarking from a "standardised Q/A" towards an interactive test paradigm.

This approach required developing many sequential versions of the same text and also extending it. Every version is saved in the github project history. Not the best way to provide a 3rd-party set of documents as a test suite. A goal was not considered at the beginning.

Moreover, this way of embedding stuff that is mere { informative, testing or at inherently obsolescense } is quite common in my way of doing (cfr. [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robang74/chatbots-for-fun/e90020ee9ec86bd5c7fc4a2d7a16fb4a3410f94f/aing/katia-cognitive-compass-core-v2.txt#:~:text=schemas%20are%20ASCII%20graphs%20that). Which often lead to move that stuff elsewhere to start another document. After all, the project has been named "chatbots for fun" and therefore it is legit for me to not provide a product or a service for free.

Accidentally, it seems that the mu-theory has a chance to be interesting also within the Physics realm. Which should not surprise anyone in AI because as much as I challenge AI in reasoning with the mu-theory, the more I am forced to improve its Physics foundations to test them on another higher level.

Unsurprisingly, a close loop of negative feedback properly managed to progressively develop a mu-theory would be useful for teaching Physics by challenging students in critical thinking. Which is also in line with "educating AI towards AGI" principle: it works for humans and AIs, both.
