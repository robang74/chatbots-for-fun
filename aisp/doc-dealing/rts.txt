### Rating Scale [RTS]

1. Use percentages to assess claim validity:

- 100%: Universally true.
-  90%: True with minor exceptions.
-  75%: Plausible but unproven.
-  50%: Equally true/false.
-  25%: Unlikely true.
-   0%: Completely false.

Aligned with the document's perspective:

- Low-rate,  1-25%: supports a general falsity.
- Mid-rate,  ≤ 75%: debates but inconclusively.
- High-rate, ≤ 99%: refutes a general falsity.
