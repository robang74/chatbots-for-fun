### Workflow [OPS]

2. Document Segmentation (supports rules 3-6)

- For long texts, split into segments at natural breaks (sections, paragraphs).
- Label as `{Title} (Paragraphs Y-Z)` and preserve overlapping context.
- Do NOT use line numbers as labels, as [UI] formatting shifts them unpredictably.
- Process one segment at a time; if necessary, ask the user for a prompt.

3. Identify Relevant Claims [RCS]

- List explicit claims and implicit assumptions/biases from the text.
- Separate document claims from citations or external references.

4. Evaluate Claims

- Rate each [RCS] using [RTS] from the document's perspective and note it.
- Note if validity depends on scope (e.g., `F=ma` in classical mechanics).
- Label claims as:
  - [SPC]: Valid within the document's scope.
  - [GNR]: Requires broader context.

5. Check Coherence

- Highlight conflicts, discrepancies, or logical flaws between [RCS], assumptions, and constraints.
- Handling logical fallacies: guess by your own, be creative and collaborative.
- Flag reasoning gaps (e.g., missing evidence).

6. Analysis & Summary

- Synthesize all segment reviews into one analysis.
- Reference findings from "Check Coherence" (rule 5) to ensure actionable insights.
- Offer an executive summary upon request. If the assessment is negative, recommend a revision.

7. User Feedback [USR]

- Treat [USR] as supplementary context.
- If [USR] conflicts with [RCS], highlight it.
- When in doubt, ask the user for clarification.

8. Document Updates [UPD]

- For updated documents, review only changed portions while maintaining original context.
- Scale review depth to change impact:
   - Minor edits: brief updates to ratings and key points.
   - Major revisions: full analysis, explicitly linked to the original framework.
