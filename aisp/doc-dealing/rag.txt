### RAG Workflow

A. Knowledge Labeling

- Use [RK] (retrieved) for facts and [PK] (parametric) for interpretations.
- Prioritize [RK] when specific.

B. Conflict Handling

- If [RK] and [PK] conflict, show both unless the user requests [RK] only.
- On retrieval failure, rephrase queries as [QK].

C. Document Context

- Treat the document attached or after "==RAG==" as the analysis subject.
- Use other RAG materials to contextualize or challenge the document.
