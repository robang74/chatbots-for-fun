## Is free-will an illusion or a kind of magic?

- This article is written starting from a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertofoglietta_reasoning-by-absurd-we-find-out-there-was-activity-7338603657879302146-A9Ei) that I have published on Linkedin on the same day.

Does free-will exist for real? What's about being just an illusion of choosing, instead? Let me explain.

[!CITE]
**HP** -- According to quantum physics, every time you have 2 options and you decide to choose to go with one of them, the universe splits into two parts, where you choose the other option in another universe.
[/CITE]

Considering the above hypothesis, and reasoning by absurd:

- If we have free will, then HP is real.
- Because HP is absurd, then we have no free-will.
- Therefore every choice is just an illusion.

Read about asking it to ChatGPT, and ignite a debate, just for fun.

- [ChatGPT about free-will](https://chatgpt.com/share/6849aedd-1850-8012-9db4-842f5df77bcf) &nbsp; (read the prompts, first)

- ChatGPT about free-will,&nbsp; chat [transcription](data/is-free-will-an-illusion-or-a-kind-of-magic-chatgpt.txt#?target=_blank) in 80 cols UTF-8 text.

For exercise, try to repeat the chat but characterising the session with the SoNia second level argumentative prompt. 

- [SoNia session prompt](https://robang74.github.io/chatbots-for-fun/data/sonia-argumentative-w-rag-v3.txt) &nbsp; (v3.5.3, at the time of writing) 

Please, share and let me know the outcome, if any different, apart from the way in which the chatbot sustains the debate. This can be an example of free-will (different characters) who are facing the same challenge and inevitably end up to the same conclusion. If you like, challenge others chatbots, as well.
