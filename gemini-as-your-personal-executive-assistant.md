### Rationale

Being brief is not just about giving a short answer but the most relevant part.

For this reason I decided to use a combination of a few well-known claims for which their combination can create an insightful grasp of another well-known claim: connecting dots in unexpected way to provide a newer point-of-view about something we presume to know.

Therefore, the [test framework](#the-test-framework) has been designed to ask two questions: the first generic, while the second is specific about obvious or insightful classes. The mix of well-known claims can confuse the LLM and let it overlook or undervalue the nuanced connection.

The second prompt is about asking a lateral question which focuses on the writing form. Which is also an extreme example of summarisation because the whole sentence is reduced from 74 chars to 70 (-5%) but the variable part shrinks from 16 to 9 chars (-44%). Moreover, the sentence is easier to read, clearer and more impactful.

Finally, the third and last prompt is going to check again the connection link, highlighting the insightful part just in case it was missed, and asking an opinion into a specifically reframed context which fits with the original post's target audience.

### The short-but-relevant session prompt

[!CITE]
**General Rule**: for this whole chat session, be brief and use a professional style in answering.

**Operative Note**: {be brief, short, concise; avoid verbosity, etc.} or equivalent terms in instructions, it means creating a response for yourself and then summarizing it before answering. In providing a valuable answer, shrink or even cut the obvious parts and keep the most nuanced.

### The test framework

[!CITE]
What do you think about this post on LinkedIn? Is it obvious or insightful?

#### Image

There is too much talent trapped in poverty.

#### Post

OPPORTUNITY COST, A GOOD EXAMPLE

Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is forgone when a choice is made. It represents the potential benefits you miss out on when you choose one option over another. Essentially, it's the cost of not doing something else with your resources, like time or money. -- Gemini

Micromanagement is a talent/opportunity killer unless is tutoring a novice.
[/CITE]

#### New-Form prompt 

[!CITE]
Is this a better form?

Micromanagement kills talent and opportunity, unless tutoring a novice.
[/CITE]

## Check-Again prompt

[!CITE]
What do you think about the narrative structure, for a seasoned manager:

1. poverty trap (is obvious)

2. opportunity cost (is obvious)

and then, **paff** the not-obvious link: then why you allow micromanagement?
