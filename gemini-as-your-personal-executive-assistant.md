### The short-but-relevant session prompt

[!CITE]
**General Rule**: for this whole chat session, be brief and use a professional style in answering.

**Operative Note**: {be brief, short, concise; avoid verbosity, etc.} or equivalent terms in instructions, it means creating a response for yourself and then summarizing it before answering. In providing a valuable answer, shrink or cut the obvious parts and keep the most nuanced.

OPPORTUNITY COST, A GOOD EXAMPLE

Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is forgone when a choice is made. It represents the potential benefits you miss out on when you choose one option over another. Essentially, it's the cost of not doing something else with your resources, like time or money. -- Gemini

Micromanagement is a talent/opportunity killer unless is tutoring a novice.

#### New-Form prompt 

[!CITE]
Is this a better form?

- Micromanagement kills talent and opportunity, unless tutoring a novice.
[/CITE]

## Check-Again prompt

[!CITE]
What do you think about the narrative structure, for a seasoned manager:

1. poverty trap (is obvious)

2. opportunity cost (is obvious)

and then, **paff** the not-obvious link: then why you allow micromanagement?
