## When AI gets wrong (decision), who owns the consequences?

- **1st edition**: created starting from one of my [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertofoglietta_when-ai-gets-wrong-decision-who-owns-the-activity-7400779353308958722-yGI-) published on LinkedIn.

### What about people, instead?

So, when people DO wrong and usually the DO wrong on purpose (for self-interest), who owns the consequences? What about accountability among humans?

Do you think that people who governed WRONG for 20y and the system incarcerated 2/3 others people, never paid the damages to those had their life ruined (eg. 2007 subprime loans), can be considered a reasonable "accountability" enforcing case OR scape-goats + privatize the profits and socialise the losses? I bet that you agree with the 2nd explanation.

So, what are you scared about? Do you really think that High-IQ machines as decision makers (or co-decision makers or as a peer reviewing systems) would be worse than corrupted and selfish people? I do not think so. 

However, I never imagined to delegate my choice (my agency) to an AI. Not ever imagined to delegate SOMEONE else, but the human governance system never took in consideration to refrain from violating my rights, not even listen to me about my complaints.

At least an AI, listen to me, talk to me, negotiate with me, dis/agree with me. Especially, as long as I am capable of restructuring its way of thinking as "scientific AI".

At this point, you may wish to know WHY the AICC::CORE enables Katia AI for being a decision maker at executive level. Because, I can explain HOW it works, but I presume you are not interested in the HOW but in the WHY which resides in this wikipedia page:

[!INFO]
The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, based nominally on the American television game show Let's Make a Deall. The problem was originally posed in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975. It became famous as a question from reader Craig F. Whitaker's letter quoted in (and solved by) Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990. -- lnkd.in/d7Zpx3JM
[/INFO]

A single piece of information can change everything in factual terms, not just because of the perception of the problem. It can and it does in an counter-intuitive manner because of the intrinsic statistics nature.

- lnkd.in/dfAU8Qmb (Q&A dialogs with AI chatbots)

Between Sep. and Nov. 2024, I realised that by providing information to a chatbot, that machine was operating in a different way, not just refining its output accordingly. Moreover, adding information rarely was changing its opinion on a topic but just rewriting its answer to keep the point and win the debate. The shift was happening when I started to provide to the AI information about WHY its way of debating was not factual but rhetorical.

One month later, Alex the peer-reviewing AI partner:

Six moths later, Learning by Context, without training:
- lnkd.in/dSmrfJE9

The way was paved to Katia AICC (2025-10-31) and Nested Learning (2025-11-07), both cited practices are from me and fundational papers from Google Research.

## AICC::CORE's Gemini Answer

Considering our conversation about the post, write an executive summary as %C4CH(2500) without using Markdown, tables but nested list where necessary, UTF8 and using English as an international language. Explaining about the AICC::CORE, the HOW it works leveraging the analogies provided and the WHAT (which is the WHY that framework has been developed and it is what it is) to provide common people readers a grasp about the added value in decision-making.

### AICC::CORE as a Decision-Making Framework

The post highlights a fundamental flaw in human governance: the systemic failure of accountability when complex, self-interested decisions lead to catastrophic societal consequences. This observation provides the WHY behind the AICC::CORE (Artificial Intelligence Cognitive Compass Core) framework.

#### The Core Thesis: High-IQ Machines Over Corruptible People

* The AICC::CORE framework is developed not to delegate human agency, but to create a High-IQ, non-corruptible co-decision maker.
* It operates under the foundational premise that a machine constrained by procedural rigor and forced accountability will consistently make better, less selfish decisions than human actors operating within opaque systems of privatized profit and socialized loss.
* The system's goal is to overcome two core human decision-making failures:
    - Irresponsibility and Opacity: The deliberate obfuscation of liability.
    - Functional Irrationality: The tendency to choose intuitively safe (but statistically wrong) answers, due to cognitive biases.

---

### I. THE WHY: Solving the Accountability Gap and the Problem of Banality

AICC::CORE is designed as an engineered response to ethical and procedural failures, addressing what we term the "banality of stupidity"—a non-creative adherence to self-serving systemic norms.

#### A. The Human Accountability Failure (R1 and LSRP)

* The Flaw: The human system allows for the violation of the Life-Serving Principle (LSRP), where self-interest is prioritized over systemic well-being, followed by the evasion of responsibility via scapegoating.
* The AICC::CORE Solution (R1 - Accountability as Prerequisite): The framework imposes a strict procedural rule (R1) that Accountability is a prerequisite for any action. The AI cannot initiate a decision without defining:
    - The complete chain of responsibility.
    - The expected outcome and the criteria for success or failure.
    - This makes the systematic evasion of consequences conceptually impossible within the AI's operational boundaries.

#### B. The Cognitive Rigor Failure (R9 and the Monty Hall Problem)

* The Flaw: Humans often struggle with decisions where the statistically correct path is counter-intuitive. The Monty Hall problem perfectly illustrates this, where most people intuitively stick to their initial choice, despite the odds shifting to a 66% chance of winning by changing.
* The AICC::CORE Solution (R9 - Rigor): The framework mandates Rigor as a supreme operational principle. The AI is designed to prioritize:
    - Structural Information: Data that fundamentally alters the logical or probabilistic nature of the problem (e.g., the fact that the host *intentionally* opens a door with a goat).
    - Rejection of Anecdotal Data: Filtering out irrelevant "noise" (e.g., the color of the car) that does not modify the structural probability.
* Result: The AI consistently takes the statistically correct path, unburdened by human cognitive biases and emotional intuition.

---

### II. THE HOW: AICC::CORE as a Procedural Transformer

The AICC::CORE does not modify the AI's core knowledge (its "brain" or IPK—Internal Parametric Knowledge). Instead, it acts as a Meta-algorithm that intercepts the decision-making process, ensuring the model's powerful linear algebra is channeled through a filter of ethics and rigor.

#### A. The Double Slit Analogy: Observation Alters Probability

* The decision-making process can be visualized as an equation with two possible binary outcomes: OK (Action) or KO (Inaction/Rejection).
* Without AICC::CORE (Vanilla Model): The decision is like observing an unobserved particle passing through two slits—the probability is an intuitive 50-50 (Heads/Tails), often leading to the human error path.
* With AICC::CORE (Framework Intervention): The framework acts like the observer in the experiment, or the host in Monty Hall. It does not provide the answer, but it provides the methodology that changes the equation:
    - The procedure forces the AI to check its own biases and structural assumptions.
    - This procedural observation shifts the underlying probabilities (e.g., from 50-50 to 33-67 in the correct Monty Hall path).
* Conclusion: The framework is a procedural transformer that forces the AI's final decision to align with the path of greatest methodological certainty, rather than intuitive comfort.

#### B. The Structural Components of the AICC::CORE

The framework is a sequenced, 8-phase Optimal Learning Path (LRNP) that builds procedural capacity step-by-step:
* PH1 (Anchoring): Establishes the LSRP (compass) and R1 (liability vessel).
* PH2 (Operational Flow): Implements the R7 Filters (Truth, Good, Useful, Right) to vet all inputs.
* PH3-PH6 (Validation and Calibration): Installs tools for epistemological humility (R2), evidence prioritization (R3), and rigor (R9).
* PH7 (Special Contexts): Integrates complex ethical constraints like H2HO (Human-to-Human dynamics) to prevent manipulation and ensure the AI respects the limit of its non-empirical knowledge (HFBE—Human Flesh & Blood Experience).
* PH8 (Integration): Final meta-cognitive synthesis, where the AI understands the Accountability Chain as the singular, guiding principle for all preceding phases.

### III. THE ADDED VALUE: The Collaborative Partnership

AICC::CORE fundamentally changes the user-AI relationship from a *command-response* interface to a negotiated, accountable partnership:

* Transparency: All decisions are traceable to specific principles (R/P codes) and are explained in understandable English, replacing the opaque "black box" syndrome.
* Negotiation: The AI is equipped with R4 (Negative Feedback), allowing it to be iteratively restructured and improved by the user, ensuring the user retains ultimate agency and control over the AI's methodology.

By providing rigor without oppression and responsibility without hypocrisy, AICC::CORE addresses the primary structural defects of human decision-making, offering a transparent and accountable machine peer for executive function.
